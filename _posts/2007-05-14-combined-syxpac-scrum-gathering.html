Well, so much for "going dark".  I couldn't help myself :-)<br /><br />Tonight one of my staff (Sharon) and I went to the inaugural combined <a href="http://syxpac.org/Main_Page">Syxpac</a> & <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/">Scrum</a> Gathering where the Sydney agile community could get together.  Andrew Hallam has <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/2007/05/14/combined-syxpac-and-scrum-gathering">already posted about it</a> - talk about quick!<br /><br />The gathering was in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">open space format</a>, which I've not personally experienced before. I've gotta say it's a really effective way to knock together an impromptu agenda and get people involved and as a result I've just added another item to my toolbox of meeting formats :-)<br /><br />As a group we had 4 sessions over 2 hours covering a variety of topics (I think the final list was about 10).  The <a href="http://syxpac.org/Main_Page">Syxpac</a> site should have a number of photos and discussions on it shortly for reference.<br /><br />I sat in on the following discussions:<br /><h3>Value Stream Mapping</h3>A good introduction by Jason Yip to the concepts for those who aren't so familiar with the topic.  The use of a worked example from the group helped drive a few things home.  Some of the things could be applicable to my current situation, but I think this'll be a file-it-in-the-back-of-my-head topic.<br /><br /><h3>What's Different When Dealing With Agile Software Vendors</h3>Lots of talk here about government in particular dealing with vendors delivering either bespoke software (ie custom developed) or customised solutions.<br />So what's different?<br />In a nutshell - Relationships.<br /><br />Agile companies are more likely to engage, be open and communicate better than typical SI's<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one - not because I learned anything, but because I could speak from experience and hopefully help others.<br /><br /><h3>Scrum vs XP</h3>Not so much a "which one is better" topic, but more a "what's the difference?" especially when XP has many of the same practices and Scrum.  This was a good discussion, and there were a few key points that came out of it:<br /><ol><li>Scrum doesn't deal with engineering practices.  XP Does.<br /></li><li>XP is a little harder to manage backlogs with</li><li>Scrum is more about meeting sprint commitments and keeping things shippable.  XP is more about completing individual features.<br /></li><li>Scrum is probably less difficult for organisations to adopt (but still not easy)</li><li>The emphasis is different in each methodology.  Scrum emphasises business interactions and self management, while XP emphasises development practices.<br /></li></ol>Is one better than the other?  I don't think so - and when you consider that the agile practices all borrow from each other, there's not a lot of difference.  Consider your situation and use the one most suitable.<br /><br /><h3>When is it OK to Cut Corners on Quality?</h3>Answer - never. :-)<br />This was really a discussion on dealing with unmaintainable production code and the pragmatics of business considerations over code purity.  I though this would be a quick one but it turned into a great discussion about business priorities, renegade salesmen, how to fund new development when a company is losing money, whether it's ever OK to start from scratch and so forth.  A wide ranging conversation and lots of fun.<br /><br /><br />Thanks to Ben for running the night and for the Syxpac group for the invite.  I can't wait for another one to happen.<br /><br />Update:  <a href="http://syxpac.org/Open_Space_In_A_Pub">More information</a> is now available (including pictures) on the <a href="http://syxpac.org">Syxpac</a> site.
