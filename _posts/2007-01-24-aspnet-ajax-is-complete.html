... well, up to version 1.0 anyway.  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu">Scott Guthrie</a> has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/23/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx">all the details</a> on his blog.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.asp.net/asp.net/images/MicrosoftASPNET.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.asp.net/asp.net/images/MicrosoftASPNET.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a><a href="http://ajax.asp.net/"> ASP.NET AJAX version 1.0</a> (the project formerly known as Atlas) is basically a framework for building AJAX functionality into .NET app's and it won't give you much out of the box.  That's where the <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/">ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit</a> comes in.  30 AJAX enabled controls for your UI pleasure - check the control demos on the web page.  Best of all the control toolkit is is a community based development effort and is therefore released under an open-source style licensing model so you can see how the controls work, hack away at them and release your own varieties if you're that way inclined.<br /><br />Being an official 1.0 release also means that it gets the full MS support life cycle behind it and that it works properly with .NET 2.0 & VS2005.  It'll be interesting to see how many other controls start popping up now that Atlas has finally made it to a final release.
