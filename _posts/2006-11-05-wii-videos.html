I've pre-ordered my <a href="http://www.wii.com/">Wii</a> now (and a copy of <a href="http://www.zelda.com/universe/game/twilightprincess/">Zelda</a>), but I also just ran across <a href="http://uk.wii.com/exp/">video's</a> of first timers playing with it.  Quite a laugh - I can now see just how silly I might be looking soon :-) but at least I'll be having fun.<br /><br />P.S. The Zelda sword fighting and the tennis &amp; bowling videos are great to watch!
