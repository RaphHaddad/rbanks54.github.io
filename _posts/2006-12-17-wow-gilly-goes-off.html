Yesterday was an awesome day of cricket!  I managed to be around to watch <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/current/player/5390.html">Adam Gilchrist</a> hit the <a href="http://aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/272887.html">2nd fastest Test Century</a> ever - missing <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/272932.html">Viv's record</a> by just 1 delivery.  And when you consider that the ball that could've brought up the record was deliberately bowled wide (and not called!) it was oh, so close!<br /><br />Still a great innings to watch - so good in fact that my lovely wife even came to watch the slaughter!<br /><br />If the capitulation of England in Adelaide wasn't enough humiliation then this should just about finish them off.  Looks like the convicts are stealing the Ashes again :-)
