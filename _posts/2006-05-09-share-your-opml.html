OPML in case you didn't know, is a list of the RSS feeds you subscribe to (ie the blogs you read).<br /><br />A new site <a href="http://share.opml.org">share.opml.org</a> exists for sharing those feeds, much like del.icio.us does for bookmarks. The site shows a number of interesting things, amongst which is the ability to find others who have a similar subscription pattern to you, so you can hunt around for other interesting blogs to read.<br /><br />Go have a look.  P.S. My feeds can be seen <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=1887">here</a>.
