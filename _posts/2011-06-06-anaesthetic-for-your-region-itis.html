<p>If your code (or the rest of your team) suffers from a bad case of #region-itis then help is at hand.</p>  <p>There’s a lovely little Visual Studio extension over at <a href="http://teamsearchapp.com/region-tool">http://teamsearchapp.com/region-tool</a> that will automatically expand #regions, and also make those #region lines much smaller and harder to read than your normal code.&#160; No more pressing shortcuts to expand all those blocks, less visual clutter and optionally, the ability to prevent collapsing of #regions.&#160; What’s not to like?</p>  <p>Borrowing a few pictures from their site, it takes the #region afflicted code (on the left) and reveals it’s ugly inner truth (on the right):</p>  <p><img alt="Regions1" src="http://teamsearchapp.com/images/regions/Regions1.png?1306892825" />&#160;<img alt="Regions2" src="http://teamsearchapp.com/images/regions/Regions2.png?1306892825" />&#160;</p>  <p>Ahh! That’s much better.</p>
