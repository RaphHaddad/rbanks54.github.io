<p>So I've been tagged by <a href="http://ducasfrancis.com/blogs/myworld/archive/2007/07/15/what-am-i-going-to-do-in-the-next-6-months-to-be-a-better-developer.aspx">Ducas</a>.&nbsp; I thought I'd avoid all this but you know what they say - "You can run, but you&nbsp;can't hide!"</p> <p>The funny thing is I don't actually consider myself as a classic developer any more.&nbsp; My recent history has been as a CTO and more often than not that&nbsp;has meant talking about technology and how it applies to business rather than implementing that technology - after all, that's what my staff did for me :-)</p> <p>When I left and joined <a href="http://www.readify.net">Readify</a> I did so as a senior consultant and even at Readify I don't spend all day coding.&nbsp; There's a lot of talking about technology that still goes on as well as mentoring, educating, guiding and listening.&nbsp; Coding definitely occurs but it's not as dominant a part of the day as one might think.</p> <p>My professional development goals this year are focussed on becoming more of a thought leader in agile methods, improving my .NET 3.0 knowledge (especially cardspace &amp; identity 2.0) and getting my head around SQL 2008.</p> <p>The thing that most interests me is the agile methodologies.&nbsp; I believe strongly that development is a whole lot more than just learning technologies and cutting the best damn code you can.&nbsp; Development is about so much more than that - it's about communication, team work, broad knowledge, good tooling, good environments, great management, a focus on quality, a willingness to work outside your specific job function, a desire to continually improve everything you do and to strive to learn more.&nbsp; Great developers show all of these traits.</p> <p>So what am&nbsp;I going to do in the next 6 months to be a better developer?&nbsp; Improve all of the above of course!&nbsp;Not just my technical knowledge and skills (which I'm still working the rust off) but the soft skills as well - and whatever opportunity I'm in, making sure I take the time to learn new knowledge just as much as I take the time to impart knowledge to others.</p> <p>Who gets tagged next?&nbsp; How about <a href="http://g2007.com/blog/gary/">Gary</a>, <a href="http://cidinoz.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.philipbeadle.net/Default.aspx?tabid=53&amp;BlogId=1">Philip</a>...</p>
