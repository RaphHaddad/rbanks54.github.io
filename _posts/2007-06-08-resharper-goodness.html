If you don't use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> you're developing with only one arm.  If you know about it but don't know if it's worth learning then have a look at <a href="http://excastle.com/blog/archive/2007/01/31/13141.aspx">31 Days of ReSharper</a>.<br /><br />Even better, if watch it being used in anger and download the (33Mb) <a href="http://www.ayende.com/97/section.aspx/download/194">video</a> of <a href="http://www.ayende.com/default.aspx">Ayende Rahien</a> demoing Rhino Mocks in a TDD scenario.  He uses ReSharper to knock out the code and itâ€™s very cool to see just how quick someone can punch out code if they know how to use their tools properly.  (the coding starts after about the 11-12 minute mark). Enjoy.
