Joel Spolsky (of <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">JoelOnSoftware</a> fame) has posted a bit of a <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">rant</a> about the quality of programmers coming out of Universities in the US lately, and blaming the problem on the lack of mental challenge current courses present.<br /><br />Having spent the last 6 months scouring the local job market (Sydney, Australia) for talented people and coming up dry I don't thinks it's a U.S. only issue.<br /><br />The completely shoddy quality of some of the candidates I've seen recently is woeful.  In fact I think I'll start blogging about some of these encounters soon.<br /><br />In the meantime have a read of the article - it's quite well written and well thought out.
