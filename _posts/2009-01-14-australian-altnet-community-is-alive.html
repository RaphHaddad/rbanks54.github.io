<p>The URL for the Sydney Alt.Net group has just changed.&nbsp; It’s now <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net">http://sydney.ozalt.net</a> (the old address will redirect). This is because we now have an <a target="_blank" href="http://ozalt.net">Australian Alt.Net community</a> at <a href="http://ozalt.net">http://ozalt.net</a> with new groups starting in <a target="_blank" href="http://brisbane.ozalt.net">Brisbane</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://perth.ozalt.net">Perth</a> over the next month or so and it’s about time the Aussie’s had an Alt.Net presence of their own.</p> <p>There’s also <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/ozaltdotnet">a mailing list</a> just for the Aussies, so if you find the fire hose that is the <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet">main alt.net mailing list</a> to daunting, feel free to converse and ask questions in quieter channels with people in your same time zone.</p> <p>The community is still growing and it’s your community, so feel free to get as involved as you like and help shape the future.</p>
