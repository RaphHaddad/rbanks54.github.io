<p>I <a target="_blank" href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2008/08/publish-tfs-build-information-to.html">posted previously</a> about the Twitter Build Publisher (aka the BuildTweeter) - a little utility that lets you publish build results and quality change events from Team Foundation Server and Team Build to Twitter.</p> <p>Well I've finally managed to find enough time to put the project up on codeplex for public consumption.&nbsp; If you want to grab a copy of it, mosey on over and download a copy now from <a title="http://www.codeplex.com/BuildTweeter/" href="http://www.codeplex.com/BuildTweeter/">http://www.codeplex.com/BuildTweeter/</a> and feel free to contribute.</p>
