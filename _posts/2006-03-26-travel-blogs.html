My sister in law and her husband just flew out of <a href="http://www.sydneyairport.com">Sydney</a> this morning for a 12 month, round the world, working holiday.  In order to keep everyone updated on where they're going they set up a blog site.<br /><br />Most people would have set up a site on <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, etc and they would have posted their photo's using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> or similar.  Instead they used a site I hadn't heard of - <a href="http://www.getjealous.com">GetJealous.com</a>.  This allows them to not only blog about what's been happening, publish photos and all that sort of stuff, but also includes the ability to publish an itinerary and see it on a world map with lines connecting all the stops and allows people to know where you are (and what the weather is there as well).  It's a nice feature and makes it easier than trying to maintain it yourself, especially as you may not be near an internet cafe for a few days or weeks.
