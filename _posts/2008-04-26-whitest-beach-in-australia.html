<p>Another quick holiday update - Wednesday we spent the day in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Le_Grand_National_Park" target="_blank">Cape Le Grande National Park</a> near <a href="http://www.visitesperance.com" target="_blank">Esperance</a> in Western Australia, which is apparently home to <a href="http://www.visitesperance.com/displaynews_text.asp?Id=8411" target="_blank">the whitest beach in Australia</a> at Lucky Bay.&nbsp; After visiting it I can understand why it's so highly rated; and the other beaches in the park aren't that far behind it.</p> <p>The water is crystal clear, the ocean is a brilliant blue and the sand is so soft and clean it's almost unbelievable. It actually crunches and squeaks underfoot and clumps up like icing sugar, just fantastic! Plus, if you have a 4WD you can drive out along Luck Bay's 3km of shoreline. Oh, and there's almost no-one around - being 750km from Perth certainly helps. Check out these shots for an idea of what I'm talking about.</p> <p>Here's my foot seen through thigh deep water - you can't do that at a city beach!</p> <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/rbanks54/SBLhKqETePI/AAAAAAAAAU8/fzhM2M7AV0M/s1600-h/image9.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/rbanks54/SBLhQKETeQI/AAAAAAAAAVE/Myt7HLlvTnE/image_thumb3.png?imgmax=800" width="561" height="484"></a> </p> <p>And here's a view towards the ocean.&nbsp; Check out the range of blues - simple amazing!</p> <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/rbanks54/SBLhV6ETeRI/AAAAAAAAAVM/RS6LCXSZSLI/s1600-h/image14.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/rbanks54/SBLhdKETeSI/AAAAAAAAAVU/_WZ_g4i-970/image_thumb8.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="439"></a> </p> <p>And finally a shot along the shore - as you can see the waves are small enough for me to take the camera into the water without fear of getting wet, and being in a national park there's no development along the coastline.&nbsp; Just Australia at it's best!</p> <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/rbanks54/SBLhi6ETeTI/AAAAAAAAAVc/_Vr7IXEmbfU/s1600-h/image15.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/rbanks54/SBLho6ETeUI/AAAAAAAAAVk/W4us7zML7pw/image_thumb9.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="442"></a></p>
