Yes, my <a href="http://www.wii.com">Wii</a> has arrived!! I stayed up until 2 in the morning playing on it and trying out the various games I've got, and I've brought it to work today for others to play with as well.<br /><br />My initial impression is WOW!! The new controller is truly amazing and a pleasure to use.  Nintendo have done a great job with this thing and it's going to change the face of gaming.<br /><br />Looks like I've got a few more late nights coming :-)
