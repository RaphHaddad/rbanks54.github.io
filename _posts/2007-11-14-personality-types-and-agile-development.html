<p>You've no doubt heard of the various types of personality profiles that exist (you can try a free one at <a title="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm" href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm</a>). The most common profile is the Briggs-Myers one though there is also one for a DPSA profile.</p> <p>The following is from the <a href="http://www.markerconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Marker Consulting</a> description of DPSA profiles</p> <blockquote> <p>DPSA profiling is an acronym for DRIVER, PROMOTER, SUPPORTER and ADMINISTRATOR. <br>D - DRIVER: Decisive and Direct. Drivers want to take charge in order to succeed and win.<br>P - PROMOTER: Outgoing and Optimistic. Promoters want to influence others and inspire them to act.<br>S - SUPPORTER: Sympathetic and Accommodating. Supporters want to help others and solve conflicts.<br>A - ADMINISTRATOR: Precise and Reserved. Administrators want to do things right and pay attention to detail. </p></blockquote> <p>And if you don't know Briggs-Myers profile it tries to type all people using four classifications: <b></p> <ul> <li>Extraversion - Introversion  <li>Sensing - Intuition  <li>Thinking - Feeling  <li></b><b>Judging - Perceiving</li></ul> <p></b>The first criterion, <b>Extraversion - Introversion</b> defines the source and direction of energy expression for a person. An extravert has a source and direction of energy expression mainly in the external world while the introvert has a source of energy mainly in the internal world. </p> <p><b>Sensing - iNntuition</b> defines the method of information perception by a person. Sensing means that a person believes mainly information he or she receives directly from the external world. Intuition means that a person believes mainly information he or she receives from the internal or imaginative world.</p> <p><b>Thinking - Feeling</b> defines how the person processes information. Thinking means that a person makes a decision mainly through logic. Feeling means that, as a rule, he or she makes a decision based on emotion.  <p>The fourth criterion, <b>Judging - Perceiving</b> defines how a person implements the information he or she has processed. Judging means that a person organizes all his life events and acts strictly according to his plans. Perceiving means that he or she is inclined to improvise and seek alternatives.  <p>Personally I came out as strong Driver on the DPSA profile, and an INTJ (Introvert, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging) with a very strong Thinking component.&nbsp; No real surprise for those who know me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the interesting things is that if you look at a basic <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html" target="_blank">description of an INTJ</a> you'll see the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>"When they are in leadership roles, they are quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well."</p></blockquote> <p>Why is this interesting?&nbsp; Simply put, <em>Agile methodologies are all about adapting how things are done to the situation at hand.</em> And this is exactly what an INTJ leans towards.</p> <p>This then leads on to another question.&nbsp; Does agile only work if people have the right personality type?</p> <p>For me, as&nbsp; a Driver with an INTJ personality, agile is right up my alley.&nbsp; But what if you're an Administrator or Supporter, or you're the opposite to an INTJ?&nbsp; Can you still succeed on an agile project?&nbsp; Will you find it as painful as a visit to the Dentist or as tedious as waiting for a <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/greglow/archive/2007/11/13/qantas-a-great-week-finally-but-then-crashing-back-to-reality-two-deplanes-in-a-single-morning.aspx" target="_blank">Qantas flight</a>?</p> <p>It's a tough question, but one worth asking.</p> <p>If you flip the agile coin and think about Waterfall projects and then have look at the <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/high-level.html" target="_blank">personality overviews</a> you could think that the ISTJ personalities would seem ideally suited to Waterfall.&nbsp; Fixed requirements delivered using a methodical, traditional approach.&nbsp; So if you put these types of people in an agile project wouldn't it make them really uncomfortable having to deal with uncertainty day in and day out?&nbsp; Could that result in team friction, poor morale or a host of other problems?</p> <p>Does it mean that forming teams means you need to have only people of certain personality types?</p> <p>It's a really interesting set of questions and something I've been thinking about for quite some time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So, to apply some very non-scientific research to my theory I'd like to do a straw poll of any who's worked in an agile project:</p> <p><em><strong>What's your personality type (both DPSA and Briggs-Myers if possible)?&nbsp; And how much did you/do you enjoy agile development?</strong></em></p> <p>Post your responses as a comment.&nbsp; I'm really curious to see the results.</p>
