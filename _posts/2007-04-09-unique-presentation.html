I ran across this on the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37Signals blog</a> - it's a very creative and unusual way to get a message across.  While it's a <a href="http://noonebelongsheremorethanyou.com/">web site</a> it also works as a presentation.<br /><br />It's amazing what you can do with a whiteboard/fridge/stove top, a whiteboard marker, a camera and a willingness to take a risk.<br /><br />The thing for me is that while it's a promotional presentation for a book it has a visual presence, sense of humour and conversational style that sets it far apart from the millions of faceless, insipid, cookie-cutter book marketing web sites that are out there today.<br /><br />Check it out<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://noonebelongsheremorethanyou.com/"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RhmTUU7rneI/AAAAAAAAABg/t92VNUKiyG0/s320/1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5051230434498420194" border="0" /></a>
