Yay!  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com.au/">Nintendo</a> has provided a <a href="http://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php">release date</a> for the <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">Wii</a>.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">December 7!</span>  And that's the Aussie release date - not far behind the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=aT85VZmuLFtGkO9m1HSsJ2PdSlh7Sc0b&page=">US on Nov 19</a> or Japan on Dec 2 and well ahead of the PS3 launch in March sometime.<br /><br />Price wise, it comes in at A$400 which is a damn sight cheaper than the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">XBox </a>360 at $650.  And that price includes <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/software_wii_sports.html">Wii Sports</a> - 5 games that make use of the one-hand controller (a nunchuk controller is included as well).  Release titles include the new <a href="http://www.zelda.com/universe/game/legendzelda/">Zelda</a> <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/software_zelda.html">game</a>, <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/software_metroid.html">Metroid Prime 3</a> and <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/software_bigbrainacademy.html">Brain Academy</a> - a Wii version of the DS <a href="http://games.nintendo.com.au/title.php?id=1043">Brain Training</a> game<br /><br />The Wii also has <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/channel.html">"channels"</a> for non-gaming activities such as photo browsing and web surfing.<br /><br />I know what I want for Christmas - time to start saving some clams!!<br /><br />Update: Here's a <a href="http://media.fairfax.com.au/?sy=smh&amp;amp;category=bulletin&amp;rid=21943">TV news article</a> about the release - the bowling demo is pretty cool :-)
