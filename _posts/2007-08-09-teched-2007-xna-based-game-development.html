<p><a href="http://lzcd.com/">Luke Drumm</a> has just presented a session on game development using <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/default.aspx">XNA</a> <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937794.aspx">Game Studio Express</a>.&nbsp; It was a very enjoyable session with the presentation shown being built using XNA (Luke actually progresses "slides" using a xbox controller).</p> <p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/default.aspx">XNA</a> looks like a fair bit of fun for doing homebrew game dev, so here's a few things I've picked up.</p> <p>XNA Game Studio Express needs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp/">Visual Studio C# Express Edition</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a hassle to set it up with VS2005 Pro so it's easier to save yourself the pain and just do a side by side installation of express and pro.</p> <p>Luke showed how simple XNA dev&nbsp;work is, and how XNA hides a lot of the complex DX9 messy stuff.&nbsp; In fact a simple 3d demo&nbsp;he showed gave no concerns to texturing, lighting, shaders, effects, or anything else.</p> <p>The speed of XNA is really good and definitely fast enough for most users.&nbsp; If you want to get fancy you can always get down to the DirectX level, but you really shouldn't have to under normal circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the best thing about XNA seems to be what doesn't need doing compared to all the effort that was required before under DirectX.</p> <p>XNA includes default Effects &amp; Shaders so that you don't need to build them for an OOTB experience which is good as the dev experience for non-default shaders is not the best (it's notepad based for now).&nbsp; Better dev experiences for shaders are available from ATI&nbsp; (rendermonkey) and NVidia but the learning curve is steeep.&nbsp; OSS variants exist (check codeplex).</p> <p>Free 3d modeling tools&nbsp;can create models in DirectX format.&nbsp; Blender is probably the most powerful, but it's also the most complex and non-intuitive to use.&nbsp; Audacity is good for sound editing.</p> <p>If you're a lazy game dev - grab a starter kit or sample (spacewar, xna racer, etc) and start hacking.</p> <p>If you're a really lazy game dev then garage games&nbsp;has torquex for building 2d games.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.blade3d.com">www.blade3d.com</a> does something similar for 3d games.</p> <p>If you're an unbelievably lazy&nbsp;game dev, then you're best bet is to go to a shop :-)</p> <p>Oh, Luke also talked a bit about Gears of War and the computing power&nbsp;required.&nbsp; The game logic required about 0.5 gigaflops.&nbsp; The physics and game updates&nbsp;took about 5 gigaFlops and the graphics required a massive 50 gigaFlops of power.&nbsp; Thankfully the GPU and hardware shaders these days are fast enough to keep up with this sort of demand.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For more info on XNA check out</p> <p><a href="http://www.virtualrealm.com.au/blogs/mykre">www.virtualrealm.com.au/blogs/mykre</a></p> <p><a title="http://creators.xna.com/" href="http://creators.xna.com/">http://creators.xna.com/</a></p> <p>and keep an eye on GameFest for XNA news over the next week or so.</p>
