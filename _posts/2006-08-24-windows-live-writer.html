<p>I've just downloaded and installed the <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/PersonalSpace.aspx?_c02_owner=1">Windows Live Writer</a> beta from Microsoft.</p> <p>I've gotta say - it's a nice piece of work.  It analysed my blog, figured out I've got a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">blogger</a> account and downloaded all my style sheets, etc so that I edit posts in the actual format they'll be shown on the blog.</p> <p>This is so much better than doing it via the blogger tool, which is just a web based rich text editor, that gives some basic formatting, but not a genuine live preview of the post you're writing.</p> <p>I'll have to spend some more time playing, but this is so cool - I think I'm sold :-)</p>
