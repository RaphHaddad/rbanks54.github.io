After 9 years this is my last day with my current employer.  It's been quite a ride and a really great opportunity.<br /><br />I've been involved in every aspect of the business, programming, design, troubleshooting, firewalls and networking, sales, marketing, trade shows, hiring and firing, starting business units, running international projects, developing new products, web site design, the works!<br /><br />What a great time!  I couldn't have wished for a more enjoyable, flexible and fun workplace.  If any of my colleagues read this - thanks for the laughs and for making each day something to look forward to instead of something to be endured.<br /><br />Monday sees me start with a new company with a focus on the educational sector.  It's quite a departure from the textile and retail sectors,  but a new challenge is what I wanted.  One of the big things I'll be looking into is moving the main application forward, so I'll need to get up to speed with .NET v2.0, esp. the ASP.NET and C# changes.  It should be fun.<br /><br />Anyway, today promises to be a bit of fun - my gamecube is in the meeting room, and a long lunch is likely.  Somehow I don't think I'll be that productive today...
