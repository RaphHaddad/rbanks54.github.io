I had a problem today, where I installed VS.NET 2003 on a laptop in which I had already installed IIS 5.1.<br /><br />The installation went smoothly, but for some reason ASP.NET didn't install, so I couldn't create any ASP.NET projects.  I then tried the uninstall/resinstall routine, and that didn't help either.<br /><br />So then I turned my attention to google, and found this little post that explains not only how to install ASP.NET to a web site, but also how to check the status.  Have a look at <a href="http://www.vimslog.net/blog/_archives/2005/6/6/913312.html">http://www.vimslog.net/blog/_archives/2005/6/6/913312.html</a>
