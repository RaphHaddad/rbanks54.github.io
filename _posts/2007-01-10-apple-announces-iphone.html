<img src="http://images.apple.com/iphone/images/sitetitle20070109.png" style="float:left;" /> The web is all of a sudden flooded with <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/technology/specs.html">iPhone</a> stories.  <a title="iPhone and the End of PC Era" href="http://gigaom.com/2007/01/09/iphone-and-the-end-of-pc-era/">Here's one</a> that includes a picture of the device and some thoughts on what this might mean in the future.<br /><br />The release is in the middle of the year in the U.S.  Hopefully it'll be the same time in Australia.  Guess it's time to start saving again...
