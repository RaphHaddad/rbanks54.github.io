<p>I love that VS2008 has finally hit the street, but I can't stand the new Akamai MSDN Download Manager that they've decided to use to distribute it.</p> <p><a href="http://lh6.google.com/rbanks54/R0JrOPezw8I/AAAAAAAAAKY/C7ipmxHCTh8/clip_image002%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="206" alt="clip_image002" src="http://lh4.google.com/rbanks54/R0JrOvezw9I/AAAAAAAAAKg/jOrL_S8LVsw/clip_image002_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg" width="787" border="0"></a> <p>It's so poorly done from a UX perspective and security perspective I just can't get over it. <p>&nbsp; <p>Here's a few different situations that I've already run across... <h3>#1 Closing Internet Explorer while Downloading</h3> <p><i>Download Manager (DLM): Do you want to stop downloading?</i> <p>Me: No <p><i>DLM: Well, I’ll close anyway</i> <p><i>DLM: </i><i>Now I’ll Restart</i> <p><i>DLM: Oops! </i><i>Your download is corrupt</i> <p><i>DLM: </i><i>Did you want to start downloading again?</i> <p>Me: Yes.&nbsp; And thanks for wasting my bandwidth!&nbsp; Grrr! <p>&nbsp; <h3>#2: Play "Where's the Download Manager"?</h3> <p>Alt+Tab to the desktop. <p>Now Alt+Tab and try and find the download manager again – it doesn’t even appear in the app list! <p>&nbsp; <h3>#3: Try to Save the File </h3> <p><i>DLM: Select the save location for the iso file.</i> <p>Me: “My Documents” (the default) <p><i>DLM: Sorry you don’t have permissions. Contact your network administrator</i> <p><i>DLM: How about I save in temp files for you.&nbsp; Do you want to open the folder?</i> <p>Me: No.&nbsp; You dumb piece of ....&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to put in My Documents! <p><i>DLM: OK, but I'm going to ignore you and I'm going to hide now... (see #2 above).</i> <p>&nbsp; <p>By the way, if you try to find the file via Windows Explorer then you'll be plum out of luck.&nbsp; You need to do the following to find it: <ul> <li>Start Windows Explorer as Admin and go to:</li> <li><i>C:\Users\&lt;&lt;YOU&gt;&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Virtualized\C\Users\&lt;&lt;YOU&gt;&gt;\Documents</i></li></ul> <p>What a corker!&nbsp; Did anyone actually test this thing?!!! <p><em></em>&nbsp; <h3>#4: Pop-Up Blocker left On</h3> <p>You go to the MSDN download page and forget that your IE Pop-up blocker is on. <p>Click the download link. <p>If you're eyes are quick you may see the IE Yellow bar appear or a fraction of a second. <p>The page refreshes almost immediately, the bar disappears so you've got no time to respond.&nbsp; If you're eyes aren't quick it just looks like the page posted back without doing anything. <p>You'll need to either turn off the pop up blocker or use ctrl+click on the file link next time. <p>&nbsp; <p>Hmm.&nbsp; Not the best piece of software in the world.</p>
