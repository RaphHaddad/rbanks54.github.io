I've got an issue with the rendering of pages in Firefox and Safari that I need to deal with.  The pages render correctly in IE, but not in the other browsers so I needed to find a way to debug the application while testing the pages using Firefox and Safari.<br /><br />I found a small post on a forum that indicated all you need to do is attach to the ASP worker Process (aspnet_wp) and it would all work.  Guess what - it's true.  I love it when things are so simple :-)
