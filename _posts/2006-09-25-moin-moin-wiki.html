I've been looking around for a decent wiki that I can use in the development area and while there are thousands and millions of half baked ideas, I haven't found anything as simple as <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/MoinMoin">Moin Moin</a>.<br /><br />Sure it was a bit crappy to install in IIS/W2K3, but most open source is.  On the plus side (and this is what I like) it's got a WYSIWYG editor so people don't have to learn stupid wiki code to write half decent pages.  The editing of pages has got to be the biggest turn off for a novice user - the idea of having to learn how many quotes to use to make something bold or italicised is nuts.  Who wants to go through yet another learning curve just to put in some formatted text!<br /><br />The whole wiki was up and running in about 15 minutes.  Now it's time to put in some content...
