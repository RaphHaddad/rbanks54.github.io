<p>After installing the Visual Studio SDK you may encounter the situation where every time you open a solution Visual Studio will automatically check out all of the project files for you.&nbsp; Immediately.</p> <p>Kind of weird, especially as you've not made any changes yet, right?</p> <p>Well, actually Visual Studio <em>has </em>made some changes for you on your behalf, just because it's trying to be "helpful".&nbsp; If you look at the differences between your project and another one you'll see a little bit of extra XML as follows:</p><pre class="codeblock">&lt;itemgroup&gt;<br />    &lt;service include="{B4F97281-0DBD-4835-9ED8-7DFB966E87FF}" /&gt;<br />&lt;/itemgroup&gt;</pre><br /><p>This is actually a known bug in the T4 DSL tool which comes with the SDK.&nbsp; And fortunately it's easy enough to resolve. <br /><p>Go to RegEdit and delete or rename the following keys (the 8.0Exp may not be present on your machine) : <br /><ul><br /><li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Packages\{a9696de6-e209-414d-bbec-a0506fb0e924} </strong></li><br /><li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0Exp\Packages\{a9696de6-e209-414d-bbec-a0506fb0e924} </strong></li></ul><br /><p><em>(64bit users should look in <strong>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\...</strong>)</em><br /><p>&nbsp; <p>Now when you open Visual Studio it will stop adding the extra XML and won't keep checking out the projects for you.
