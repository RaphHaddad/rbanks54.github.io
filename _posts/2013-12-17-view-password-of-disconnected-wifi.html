Disclaimer: This post is a 'note to self' reminder post, though if you find it useful I'm happy I could help.<br /><br />As a consultant I tend to jump around various networks and when working with other consultants it's not uncommon to need to share WiFi passwords for networks that you aren't currently connected to. The problem is, Windows 8 dropped the "Manage Wireless Networks" feature so this isn't as easy as it used to be but there is a simple way.<br /><br />How to:<br />1. Open a command prompt<br />2.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: courier; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"><b>netsh wlan show profile name=[network name] key=clear</b></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: courier; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"><b><br /></b></span>That's about it. Simple.<div><br /><div>Credit to LifeHacker where I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/delete-wi-fi-networks-in-windows-8-from-the-command-lin-513411677" target="_blank">originally found the info</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. netsh is also useful for deleting profiles of the various public hotspots you've used.
