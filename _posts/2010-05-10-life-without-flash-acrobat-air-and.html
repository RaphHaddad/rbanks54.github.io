<p>So I recently reached the tipping point of frustration and I got so sick of Adobe Flash causing problems on my system that I decided I’m over it, and over Adobe products in general.&#160; The software they release is just so poor I don’t want it any more and I’d rather live without it even if there’s no valid alternatives.</p>  <p>I’ve now uninstalled all the Adobe products I can from my machine and disabled Flash extensions in my browsers where I couldn’t uninstall it and have been running like this for the past few weeks now.</p>  <p>As such I thought you might be curious as to how this is affecting me and my online life, so let me give you a run down on how I’m finding the experience now.</p>  <h4>PDF Files</h4>  <p>First up, the easy one.&#160; Acrobat Reader.&#160; 140MB of installation and a reboot every time there’s an update.&#160; Just to view PDF files? Seriously? Plus it’s fast becoming one of the more targetted security attack vectors now that Microsoft have picked up their game.&#160; So I replaced Adobe Reader with FoxIt reader which is only a measly 10MB in size and it does a great job of viewing PDF files.&#160; I don’t know why I didn’t dump Reader years ago – FoxIt is just so much nicer and so much faster!&#160; No brainer decision, that one.</p>  <h4>Flash on the Web</h4>  <p>And what about the web experience? Flash is the choice du jour of interactive web sites and there are so many sites with flash on them that surely I won’t be able to live without it.&#160; Now admittedly I could have installed a flash blocker and then turned flash on as and when I wanted to, but I was just so annoyed with Adobe I wanted to so get rid of their malware that I went the whole hog and disabled/removed the plugins from my various browsers (though Chrome was particularly annoying since I have to disable all plugins to remove Flash).</p>  <p>The experience without Flash isn’t always great, but I’m happy to deal with it.&#160; Let me give you some examples of what I mean:</p>  <h5>Google Analytics</h5>  <p>I use analytics a bit to keep track of this blogs readership stats along with a few other sites I have.&#160; Here’s what it looks like sans Flash:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0lqtkTeI/AAAAAAAAAuU/tQnVuj3MTVs/s1600-h/image%5B4%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0nTyet2I/AAAAAAAAAuY/T-q26cdAODQ/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="353" /></a> </p>  <p>I lose the funky charts but the data is still available.&#160; I can definitely live with that.</p>  <h5>General Web Sites</h5>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0orwcuSI/AAAAAAAAAuc/Wj3_ktsXom8/s1600-h/image%5B8%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0pvyejRI/AAAAAAAAAug/-LEPdT-DYFk/image_thumb%5B4%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="283" /></a> </p>  <p>Still playing WOW? Meh.&#160; Play a real MMO – one with great lore, an epic story line and no 13 year olds trying to trash talk you from 6,000 kms away.&#160; Anyway – gaming choices aside, the lack of flash on many sites means no Ads.&#160; Such a shame to lose them.&#160; Really.&#160; NOT!!</p>  <h5>Grooveshark</h5>  <p>I hit this site every now and then to listen to streaming music.&#160; For Grooveshark and many other sites on the web Flash it the only option for streaming audio via web pages.&#160; Most podcast episodes are embedded into blog pages using it.&#160; I even use it on the <a href="http://talkingshopdownunder.com" target="_blank">Talking Shop Down Under</a> episode posts because it’s what my audio file host (archive.org) provides out of the box.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0qW9OdPI/AAAAAAAAAuk/2P566Tqp2u0/s1600-h/image%5B12%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0rSwTy1I/AAAAAAAAAuo/Jj7DT5YAs9w/image_thumb%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="142" /></a> </p>  <p>Podcasts aren’t a big deal for me since I subscribe to them via iTunes and listen to them on my iPod/iPhone.&#160; As for grooveshark? I’ll just make do without.&#160; No biggie.</p>  <h5>YouTube</h5>  <p>OK, so this is an important one.&#160; Video on the web is almost always done with Flash, though hopefully people will start moving to Silverlight smooth streaming or HTML5 video sooner rather than later.&#160; In fact YouTube already has – if you have a HTML5 capable browser that supports video (aka Chrome) then you can go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">http://www.youtube.com/html5</a> and join the beta program and watch video via HTML5 instead of Flash.&#160; It doesn’t do full screen yet, but apart from that it works perfectly well. Happy days.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0sEjpDHI/AAAAAAAAAus/0zlc5SB8Sm8/s1600-h/image%5B21%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0tZqhGYI/AAAAAAAAAuw/PRODGAqJjgk/image_thumb%5B11%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="383" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0uEA5m6I/AAAAAAAAAu0/ahMyFteFE4I/s1600-h/image%5B22%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/S-d0vQolRwI/AAAAAAAAAu4/ETlFLvTx4fw/image_thumb%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="171" /></a> </p>  <p>Sites like Viddler, Tekpub and others still don’t offer Flash alternates so occasionally I run into situations where I can’t view videos, but once again I’m happy to live with that for now.</p>  <h4>Adobe Air</h4>  <p>So this was a pretty simple one.&#160; I use Air for one thing and one thing only and that was so I could run TweetDeck.&#160; I got rid of Air and TweetDeck and switched to Seesmic so I could retain the multiple account support and I’m happy with it for now.&#160; Of course, there are plenty of other twitter clients out there that run natively on Windows and I could have just as easily used one of them if they had multiple account support too. (Halfwit, MahTweets, etc)&#160; If they add that functionality in the future I may switch.&#160; It’s not a hard thing to change :-)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p></p>  <p>So there you have it, life without Adobe.&#160; And as a parting note, I haven’t had a browser or system crash ever since I got rid of their software.&#160; Goodbye Adobe.&#160; You won’t be missed.</p>
