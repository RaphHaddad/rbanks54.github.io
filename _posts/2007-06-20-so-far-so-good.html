<p><a title="Readify" href="http://www.readify.net" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 10px" src="http://www.readify.net/Portals/_default/Skins/Readify/logo1.gif" align="left"></a>I've now been at <a href="http://www.readify.net">Readify</a> for about 3 weeks now and I've got to say things are going pretty well.</p> <p>I've just completed my second engagement; a review of a "Classic" ASP application and I'm starting to settle into the senior consultant role fairly comfortably.&nbsp; It's still weird not being able to have water-cooler chats or random banter with colleagues during the day and I'm definitely missing some of those social elements that exist in an office, but at the same time <a title="Careers with Readify" href="http://www.readify.net/Default.aspx?tabid=84">working in a virtual company</a> has it's advantages.&nbsp; When I'm not on site, I'm able to save about 2.5 hours a day in travel, I can drop off and pick up my kids from school, I can duck out to the gym when I feel like it (instead of at 6 in the morning) and I can be flexible in the times I work and where that work happens.</p> <p>I'm finding that a work from home day usually starts a bit earlier and finishes a bit later than a normal day used to (ie&nbsp;I start about 7:30am and finish about 9:00pm) but that's because of the gaps I make in it.&nbsp; I still do a normal days work, it's just a lot more broken up then when I'm in an office.</p> <p>One thing I'm not missing is the stress of management.&nbsp; There were some things going on in the&nbsp;company I left&nbsp;that were quite draining and being able&nbsp;to leave all that behind and just concentrate on doing a top job for my clients is so much easier to deal with.</p> <p>And what of <a href="http://www.readify.net/readify+bloggers.aspx">the people I'm working with</a>?&nbsp; Well, they're the cream of the crop.&nbsp; There's a large number of Microsoft MVPs in the company and some other very smart people on board.&nbsp; The work these guys have done is fantastic, and I'm lucky to now be a part of it all.</p>
