<p>For the longest time (i.e. since I first used a password) I’ve always kept passwords in my head.&#160; In the early days it was easy since systems were isolated and pesky password policies hadn’t yet become the norm.&#160; It was usually easy to remember, because the number of unique passwords I had was, um, just one.</p>  <p>Then over time those password policies started to appear and I had to start thinking of new passwords for more places that wanted more security, typically by varying my single core password.&#160; Then they introduced password history, and dictionary checks and all sorts of things which now meant I had to remember what all the various incarnations were.&#160; My capacity for password rememberising was fast reaching full.</p>  <p>What made it harder is that with more and more things being on the internet I was also getting an account explosion and starting to forgetting what login id I was using, especially when it was for a site I hardly used, so I’d often find myself doing the ol’ “forgotten password” thing.&#160; Side note: It’s a scary experience when the forgotten password thing results in you being emailed your current password.&#160; Yikes!</p>  <p>Anyway, I knew this wasn’t best practice,and there were plenty of people saying “use a password manager” but the conceived hassle for me of trying to keep passwords in sync between different machines was a massive turn off.</p>  <p>Anyway, after reading Jeff Atwood’s little <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001262.html" target="_blank">cautionary tale</a> and his <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001263.html" target="_blank">follow up</a> about how his own password got hax0red I decide enough was enough, time to man up and get over my anti-password-manager mentality.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/SrrS05Pt38I/AAAAAAAAArs/MlrZOm-e69k/s1600-h/main_big%5B1%5D%5B5%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="KeePass screenshot" border="0" alt="KeePass screenshot" align="left" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/SrrS16A8VKI/AAAAAAAAArw/lNTt2gbT8aQ/main_big%5B1%5D_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="187" /></a> So first things first, I did some poking around the googleweb and found <a href="http://keepass.info/" target="_blank">KeePass</a> and decided to give it a try.</p>  <p>Why this one and not others? Well, first – it’s free! :-) But mainly it’s because    <p>it’s portable and because it has a really cool AutoType feature where with a single key combo (ctrl_alt_a) I can get my passwords autotyped into whatever app I happen to be using.&#160; So it’s now not only is it remembering my passwords for me, but it’s also saving me keystrokes.&#160; Heaven!&#160; There’s a slew of other things it does as well which I really like, but you can go check those out for yourself.</p>    <p>Anyways, I used it for a while to see if it worked for me and got to enjoy and appreciate what it did.&#160; But it still didn’t solve my problem of wanting to maintain my passwords only once but have them available on any of the machines I have, even when I don’t have an internet connection.&#160; This is where the portability factor becomes valuable.&#160; You can take the app, copy it to a USB stick and just plug it into whatever computer you happen to be using and it’ll work.&#160; However the idea of chewing up a USB slot just for the password manager didn’t appeal to me.&#160; It’s too clumsy to keep plugging the thing in all the time and there’s a good chance I’d do something stupid and lose the USB drive.</p>    <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/SrrS2kk3CPI/AAAAAAAAAr0/63iSP-873eQ/s1600-h/image%5B7%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/SrrS3_675WI/AAAAAAAAAr4/guCo-gilKag/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="195" /></a>Enter Live Mesh.&#160; To get the “on every machine” thing working I just created a live mesh folder and synchronised the KeePass folder with my mesh.&#160; Now whenever I update my passwords all I have to do on the other machines is make sure Mesh had synced and do a quick restart of KeePass to pick up my new changes and I’m all set.&#160; Everything just works beautifully</p>    <p>I’ve been doing this now for about 3 months and I’m loving it!&#160; I’m gradually replacing all my crappy passwords with stringer ones generated by the tool and feeling a lot more secure about my online identity.</p>    <p>As a note, I probably won’t change my twitter password as I use twitter from web kiosks, my windows mobile phone (though there is an unofficial KeePass port for the mobile) and other places where I don’t have access to my mesh folder.</p>    <p>If you’re in the same situation i was in before, then maybe it’s time you started looking at how you too can get to love a password manager :-)</p></p>
