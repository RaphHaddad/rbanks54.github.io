(Wow, it's been a while since I posted - sorry, all!)<br /><br />In case you aren't aware, there's a few developer events coming up that I'm involved in that I thought you might like to know about.<br /><br /><h3>DDD Sydney - May 28th</h3><br /><a href="http://dddsydney.com.au/">http://dddsydney.com.au/</a><br /><br />I'll be talking about Architecting Microservices in .NET. &nbsp;Should be fun :-)<br /><br /><h3>Agile 2016 - July 25th -29th</h3><br /><a href="http://agile2016.agilealliance.org/">http://agile2016.agilealliance.org/</a><br /><br />I'm co-chairing the Dev Practices and Craftsmanship track this year. I'm pretty excited about the content and we've got some great speakers and amazing topics if you can make it.<br /><br /><h3>NDC Sydney - Aug 1st - 5th</h3><br /><a href="http://ndcsydney.com/">http://ndcsydney.com/</a><br /><br />I'll be jumping off the plane from Atlanta and doing 2 talks<br /><br />The first is a variation of the Microservices talk I'm doing at DDD Sydney, and the second is a talk on the revamped build system in VSTS and integrating with SonarQube for automated metrics and technical debt monitoring.<br /><br /><br />There's still tickets available to all 3 events, so I'd encourage you to have a look through the content at all of them and see what takes your fancy. There's always something new to learn in this field, and I'd love to see you there!<br /><br />
