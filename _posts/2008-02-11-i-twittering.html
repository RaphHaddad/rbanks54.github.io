<p>Thanks, I think, to <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Jim Benson</a> (aka OurFounder) and <a href="http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Darren Neimke</a> both talking about <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2008/01/what-is-a-socia.html" target="_blank">social</a> <a href="http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!15630F96CB7D86C1!702.entry" target="_blank">networking</a> recently and as a practical follow up to my own semi-related <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2008/02/i-get-by-with-little-help-from-my.html" target="_blank">post about it</a>, I'm now finally twittering.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've sworn in the past that I wouldn't do this because of the <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/12/twitter-causes-brain-thrashing.html" target="_blank">attention breaking issues</a>, however I've found that it's actually pretty easy to tune out when I need to get stuff done. I suppose it's just personal discipline.&nbsp; A bit like ignoring the <a href="http://www.readify.net" target="_blank">Readify</a> tech list and only reading blogs at the start/end of the day.&nbsp; I think I may have to eat my words on this one.&nbsp; Either that or admit I'm a twit - how embarrassing!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Anyhoo - if you want to subscribe to my updates you can find me at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rbanks54">http://www.twitter.com/rbanks54</a></p>
