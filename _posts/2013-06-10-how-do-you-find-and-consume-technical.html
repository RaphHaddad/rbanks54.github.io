I’ve been asked by the publisher of my VS2012 book if I want to go on a second date with them and write a VS2013 one. At the moment I’m undecided. The publishing experience was great and the publisher was good to work with, but I’m not sure if a book is the best way to get content out there and into the hands of the most people.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I've been asked if I want follow up my VS2012 book with a VS2013 one. Thinking of writing the content as blog posts/video instead. Thoughts?<br />— Richard Banks (@rbanks54) <a href="https://twitter.com/rbanks54/status/344046325035311104">June 10, 2013</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>  <br />I wrote the first book, in part, to better understand the publishing process and the rigor involved and from that perspective it was wonderful and I learned a lot. On the downside, writing the book meant I put the Talking Shop Down Under podcast on hold to make the time for it, probably permanently, and that was something I really enjoyed doing and was helping people learn.<br /><br />Now I’m wondering if I should do something else to get content out there. Obviously I could do audio content, but does that really work for people, especially if it’s technical? Do I do longer content or short “did you know?” bite sized things? Do I put written content out there for reference? Do I do standalone video? Or maybe text content backed by video? Or try something else entirely? My mind is far from made up, I just know I want to do something that people enjoy and get value from, and that gets the widest reach.<br /><br />If you wanted to learn something about visual studio, how would you find it? Book store/Amazon? Search engines? Somewhere else?&nbsp; And once you found it, how would you like it presented to you?<br /><br />Leave your thoughts as comments on this blog post, or ping me directly via twitter.
