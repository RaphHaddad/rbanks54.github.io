<p>OK, so you probably don't want to do this for internal projects (CCTray works great for that), but if you've got an open source project and you're using <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/cruisecontrol">CruiseControl.NET</a> then it might be an idea to let your community know about it.</p><p>You can't have them all downloading CCTray and pinging away at your server all day, but you can let them listen to a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> feed of your build notifications.  If that's something interesting for you, then have a look at the <a href="http://thomasfreudenberg.com/blog/archive/2007/06/17/twitter-publisher-for-cruisecontrol-net.aspx">Twitter Publisher for CC.NET</a>.</p><p>At long last something useful to do with Twitter.</p>
