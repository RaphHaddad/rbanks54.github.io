<p></p> <p>I was just reading some posts on the scrumdevelopment mailing list and saw <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scrumdevelopment/message/29958" target="_blank">this from Roy Morien</a> about traditional software development: <p>&nbsp; <p><b><i>Traditionally software development processes have been predicated on the following assumptions:</i></b><i></i> <p><i></i> <p><b><i>1. It is possible, efficient and effective to create a thorough and complete analysis of the requirements for a system, at the start.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>2. Is it possible to plan in detail the development project, even 2-3 years ahead.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>3. It is possible to provide accurate estimates of the cost of the project, and of the development time and completion date.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>4. Requirements are stable and will remain unchanged during the project period.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>5. Following the plan is the best way to ensure project success.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>6. A serial or linear phased development approach is the best , most efficient most effective approach to software development.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>7. Software development is fundamentally a technical activity that is repeatable, and can be planned and managed according to a preconceived plan.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>8. Software projects can be undertaken in the same way as civil engineering projects, which is orderly, linear and sequential.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>9. Certainty of outcomes can be achieved if only we properly, correctly and comprehensively plan, analyse, estimate, document and properly manage the project.</i></b><i></i> <p><b><i>10. Project success is counted in terms of 'Within Budget, Within Time, Within Scope'</i></b><i></i> <p><i>I then made the statement&nbsp; "On every count, these assumptions have been demonstrated to be incorrect", and I proceeded to discuss why, and the evidence of that.<br>Basically I discussed the simple fact of 'Future Uncertainty". This really is the core problem that all of these 10 assumptions fail on. <br>I was a bit surprised at the audience reaction ... It was almost like many of them had never really thought about this in this way. To have their basic underlying project management principles shown as almost totally flawed seem to come as a bit of a shock to them. <br></i> <p>Personally, I'm not at all surprised.&nbsp; I see the same reaction over and over again in almost every place I go.&nbsp; Almost every single project manager is taught a one size fits all project management methodology (typically PMBOK or PRINCE2) by an esteemed educational institution and no alternate options are ever discussed, so why would they think that the methodology they've been taught can't work for software development?&nbsp; Especially if they've never actually done any development themselves. <p>Hopefully the increasing awareness of the problems with traditional software development and the alternative of agile methodologies will finally result in educational institutions teaching prospective PM's something that actually works in the real world.</p>
