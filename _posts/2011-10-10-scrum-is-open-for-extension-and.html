<p>The title says it all really.</p>  <p>Modifications to the framework need to be approved by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland (co-creators of Scrum), and to be honest there are likely to be very few, given it’s such a simple framework.</p>  <p>The more interesting thing to keep an eye on will be the Extensions.&#160; As a Scrum Coach and Trainer, I’m often asked what teams should do in a specific scenarios.&#160; Scrum is silent on those situations because they aren’t generic enough, and yet there are generally accepted, healthy behaviours teams should have in those situations.&#160; That’s the essence of an extension.&#160; The healthy, beneficial practices team can use to complement Scrum to help teams in Situation X.</p>  <p>This a is great move by <a href="http://www.scrum.org">Scrum.org</a> and a very welcome one!</p>  <p><a href="http://www.scrum.org/scrum-extensions/">Scrum Extension Library</a> and <a href="http://www.scrum.org/extend-mod-scrum/">Submission Guide</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.scrum.org/scrum-guide-proposal/">Scrum Modification Submission Guide</a></p>
