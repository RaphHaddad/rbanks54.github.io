<p>I'm pleased to say that I've just added some more noise to cyberspace and published <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/nunit4teambuild" target="_blank">NUnit for Team Build</a> on CodePlex.&nbsp; This is the project where the scripts I used for <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2008/06/merging-nunit-build-results-into-tfs.html" target="_blank">merging NUnit results into Team Build</a> will live.</p> <p>I hope you find it useful.</p>
