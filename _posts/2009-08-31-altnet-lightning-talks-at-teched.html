<p>This just in:</p>  <p><i>Your Birds of a Feather Session Proposal, BOF003 &quot;Alt.Net Lightning Talks&quot; has been approved and will run at lunchtime (1245-1345) on Thursday 10 September in Meeting Room 7</i></p>  <p>So, we’ve got an hour to fill with fun and giggles.&#160; If we take a few minutes for setup and so forth we'll have enough time for 4 sessions and some Q&amp;A.</p>  <p>With that in mind, I’m looking for session proposals so either jump on to <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/ozaltdotnet">the mailing list</a> and post a proposal if you’re going and would like to do a talk, or just ping me <a href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54" target="_blank">on twitter</a> or send me an email. Remember, talks will be for 10 minutes MAX.</p>
