<a href="http://www2.blogger.com/www.windowsvista.com">Vista's</a> been out and about now for quite a while and I've finally decided to take the plunge and start the process to roll out both Vista and Office 2007 within the company.<br /><br />At this stage I've just been doing some initial testing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-food">dog-fooding</a> it.  A few things have been "interesting" and there's some kinks to work through but on the whole I'm pretty happy with it.<br /><br />What are the kinks - well <a href="http://www.symantec.com/smb/products/overview.jsp?pcid=vir_prot&pvid=av_ent">Symantec A/V</a> doesn't work in Vista.  Symantec told us that they had a 10.2 version that works in Vista and that they'd make it available for us, but after 3 days and repeated attempts they haven't.  Yeah; nice work Symantec.  I'll be sure to tell all my friends about your above and beyond service - not.<br /><br />What else - VS2003 isn't supported (<em>what the</em>...<em> !?</em>). We still have some older .NET 1.1 code to support so we need it.  It's meant to work but "advanced debugging" features are busted.  I've still got to try and find these problems, and if I run into them then I guess it'll be a virtual pc image for the support work.<br /><br />VS2005 has to run under admin privileges.  Not really a big deal, but it's a pain hitting the button to run under admin each time.  The same applies to SQL2005.<br /><br />IIS7 is installed with Vista so setting up a web application is a little different but so far so good.<br /><br />What else?  Um, not a lot really; other than a big learning curve trying to figure out where everything lives, and trying not to get gadget-distracted.<br /><br />Office 2007 is really, really nice.  I'm still getting used to where some things live and some of the changes, but it's very cool.<br /><br />So, this week.  I'll trial it with a few more people and see what problems they have, and then start a rollout for everyone.<br /><br />After that - time to look into the servers.  Sharepoint 2007, Exchange 2007, etc.
