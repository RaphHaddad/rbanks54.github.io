No, I'm not dead - I'm still travelling at the moment (currently in Hope, BC, Canada) and I've finally managed to get a few spare minutes at a hotel's PC (thanks to the Hope Quality Inn) when the kids aren't after attention and when I'm not actually doing anything - which has been rare.<br /><br />The holiday so far has been fantastic - down through alaska's inside passage, through the rockies and now heading back to Vancouver, before leaving for Hawaii tomorrow.  I've got over 4000 photos stored on the iPod now so I should be able to post some good images once I get back to Australia and sort through them all.<br /><br />I'll also try and post a bit of a day-by-day summary of things and try and show some of what happened.  More posts will follow.<br /><br />Aloha :-)
