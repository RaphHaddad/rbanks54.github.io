The internal dev wiki I installed yesterday is starting to take shape.  I started by putting a few different documents there and seeing how things go.  The team also has full access to the wiki so they can put up whatever they like as well.<br /><br />One of the cool things about MoinMoin is it's inbuilt diff tool.  It makes it really useful for managing use cases as the diff tool helps in seeing what changes have been made.  This helps developers understand what's changed and in turn help them focus their efforts more quickly in their code.
