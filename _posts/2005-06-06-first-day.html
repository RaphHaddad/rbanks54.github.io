I started in my new role at a new company today and it's been quite a busy day!  I walked into the office first thing this morning and exactly 1 minute later I was in the board room in a meeting with another company about software development.  That meeting then extended into another which went until lunch, and then from there I had a quick break before being thrown deep end into yet another one.  When they told me in the interviews that I needed to get up to speed quickly, I understand why :-).<br /><br />I haven't yet had a chance to look through the code or get a handle on the current development processes.  Once I've done that, then it'll be time to look at ways to improve things.  Given the conversations I've had today I'm pretty sure I'll be targeting testing and quality assurance first.  I'll also need to see if any of my developers have done and TDD or been exposed to agile methods before.<br /><br />It's all very interesting and it looks like this has been a good move for me.
