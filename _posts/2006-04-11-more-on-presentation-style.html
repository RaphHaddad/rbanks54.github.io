Continuing my kick into improving how I deliver presentations and communicate messages to groups of people I ran across a blog entry at <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/">PresentationZen</a> describing the differences between <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/11/the_zen_estheti.html">Bill Gates and Steve Jobs</a>.  Jobs is widely regarded as a great presenter and Gates as somewhat mundane and tedious.  This helps explain why.<br /><br />P.S. I know which style I prefer :-)
