In software development the value of having the best people you can get can't be understated.<br /><br />Now, the clamour for good .NET developers in Australia is just nuts at the moment. The demand is so far outstripping supply that any developer worth their salt is snapped up in no time flat. In fact any programmer who write the hello world program and get it to compile in under 1 hour is snapped up with glee, and even those that like licking windows and can't tell what those bumpy things on the keyboard are for still seem to get great jobs. It's just crazy at the moment.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.readify.net/">Readify</a> (my employer) is a premier employer for top .NET talent and has, at last count, 10 Microsoft MVP's on board, plus a bunch of other extremely talented and gifted individuals. We're hiring at the moment and we're feeling the pinch of a dried up talent pool as much as anyone else.<br /><br />So in such an environment how does Readify find the best people they can? How do they attract top talent and how do they get people to see them as an employer of choice? Well, top people know other top people, which can help you know who's becoming available. And there's the company itself - the virtual structure, the "elite commando's" sense of working with the best of the best, the fact that Readify keeps ahead of the curve with the latest technologies, that they provide staff with one month of paid Professional Development per year, that they give people opportunities for public speaking through the <a href="http://www.readify.net/rdn.aspx">RDN</a> and all the other miscellaneous benefits. And then there's the fact that they look in unusual places for great talent. Take for instance the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msozacademic/archive/2007/11/07/news-just-in-aussie-imagine-cup-entrants-can-win-a-job.aspx">Imagine Cup</a>.<br /><br />As part of sponsoring the Imagine Cup this year the top 3 Australian teams will all win jobs with Readify in the Readify Dev Centre. How good is that?<br /><br />What a great way to find and attract the up and coming talent!<br /><br />It sure beats posting endless job offers on seek.com.au and being the same as everyone else.<br /><br />Now if you're ineligible to enter the cup and you're not happy in your current job (or you live overseas and you're thinking of a move to Australia) don't despair - Readify is still interested in you. So if you think you've got what it takes to join the best technical people in Australia <a href="http://www.readify.net/Default.aspx?tabid=84">apply for a job</a> today.
