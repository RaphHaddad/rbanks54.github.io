The current dot com boom is focused around Web 2.0 sites.  The definition of what a Web 2.0 site is changes depending on who you're talking to, what phase the moon is in and how much interest Google and Yahoo! are paying to it.<br /><br />The good news is that even if you don't know what one is, you can still create one, sell your hair-brained idea to a venture capitalist who just looks at the visuals and have a big bag of cash come your way!  How?  By simply <a href="http://web2.ajaxprojects.com/web2/newsdetails.php?itemid=29">following the instructions</a> of course!<br /><br />And if you just want a visual refresh to your web site so you can look like the rest of the cool kids then these might actually be useful instructions.  Enjoy!
