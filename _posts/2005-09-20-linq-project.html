ObjectSpaces is reborn!  The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/default.aspx">LINQ</a> project is a codename for Microsoft's new object/relational framework that will be built into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/default.aspx">.NET 3.0</a> (yes it's already on the drawing board).
<br />
<br />The syntax and the inbuilt language integration means that you can do mapping and object retrieval directly in your code without having to reference any other framework(s) and the project borrows from many of the concepts common to any mature object relational framework.
<br />
<br />My only gripe is that at the moment it looks like it only uses attribute based mappings.  There is no external mapping facility so slight schema changes are a little difficult to handle, also some of the interactions (such as dbtype descriptions) have the potential to be too database specific since they incorporate syntactical elements of the target database.  Apart from that, it's got a lot of potential and could actually mean the end of demand for products such as the <a href="http://jcframework.sourceforge.net">AtomsFramework</a>, etc.
