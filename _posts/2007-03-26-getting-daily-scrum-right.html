<p>Daily scrum meetings are meant to be a coordination and communication session for the team.&nbsp; A way to kick off the day and keep things going in the right direction.</p> <p>They're simple enough in concept.&nbsp; Just ask the three questions - What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? What got in your way?&nbsp; Easy!</p> <p>But is that really all there is to it?&nbsp; Well, not quite and it's surprisingly easy to get it wrong, or even worse to start out OK and develop bad habits.</p> <p><a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/">Jason Yip</a>&nbsp;has an article about <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html">Patterns of Daily Stand-up Meetings</a> that is well worth a read.&nbsp; I've just read through it and realised I've let a few "bad smells" creep into in my meetings, things&nbsp;that just kind of developed over time.&nbsp; I think it's time for me to take some corrective action :-)</p>
