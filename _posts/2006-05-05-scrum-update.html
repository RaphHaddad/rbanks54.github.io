I've been using scrum as part of our development process for about 4 months now.  During this time things have progressed really well.  The team has taken to the new process really well and with the number of staff increasing I now run 4 separate teams across different areas of the product.<br /><br />About the only thing I had to correct is the occasional breaking of the rules by the team, and that's been due to good intentions rather than deliberate action.<br /><br />We're now able to see real benefit from the process now and are showing clear improvements in the product every few weeks.   As a way of saying thank you to the team and showing how much I appreciated their great effort I took them out for lunch today.   It was lots of fun in a good environment, overlooking Darling Harbour and eating great good.
