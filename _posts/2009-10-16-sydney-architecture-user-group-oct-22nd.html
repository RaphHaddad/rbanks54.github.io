<p>Just thought I’d let you all know that I’ll be speaking at the first meeting of the Sydney Architecture User Group next week (you’ll find the group <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=161478795632" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>).&#160; So, if you’re in Sydney on Thursday Oct 22nd then head on over the the Grace Hotel, 77 York St, at 6pm and I’ll see you there.&#160; We’ll be in one of the function rooms – just check the board as you enter the hotel to see which one.</p>  <p>For those of you who want to know what I’m talking about – it’s Architecture in the Small and this is the abstract: <em>No matter how good your design or how well the big pieces of your architecture fit together it's the little things that really count. The little things are the things that can take your vision of beauty and either make it a reality or turn it into a thing of nightmares. Richard will talk about what these little things are, the impact they have and, most importantly, what to do about them.</em></p>
