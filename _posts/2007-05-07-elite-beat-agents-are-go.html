On Friday I toddled off to the nearest EB Games store and handed over some hard earned for a copy of <a href="http://elitebeatagents.com/">Elite Beat Agents</a> for the Nintendo DS.<br /><br />This game has been getting <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/elitebeatagents?q=elite%20beat%20agents">first class reviews</a> from various game sites and I've been curious as to how good it really is so I took a (small) risk and grabbed a copy.  Needless to say, I'm very happy; and very addicted.<br /><br />EBA is simple in concept - just hit numbers on the screen in time to the music - but it's executed so very, very well.  Now I usually play games on the DS during the commute, but with this game I've played it across the weekend, took it to friends and got my wife to play (though I had to wait a while to get it back).  It's great fun - even for a rhythmically challenged person such as myself.<br /><br />If you've got a DS then go get a copy (or find someone to swap with) and have some genuine fun.  I'm going to end this post now - the siren call of the Agents is getting loud again and I must answer. .. I cannot refuse...
