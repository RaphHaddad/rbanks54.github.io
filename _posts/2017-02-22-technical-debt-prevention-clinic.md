Last week I was at [Microsoft's Ignite Australia](https://msftignite.com.au/) conference where I presented three different talks.

This talk is on technical debt, what it is, and what it isn't and ways you can both reduce and prevent it.

This was a fun talk and was well received by the audience. I hope that comes across in the recording!

Slides are availabe from [https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/NET342](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/NET342)
