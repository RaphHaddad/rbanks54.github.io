If you've ever had to demo something and you use keyboard shortcuts it can be a pain to keep telling people what you were pressing.  There's now a cool little utility to track those keyboard shortcuts and show them to the audience without having to tell them what you pressed.<br /><br />It's called <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/05/28/introducing-shortcut-watcher-show-your-keyboard-magic-while-presenting.aspx">ShortWatcher</a> (I know - sounds a bit suspect!) and you can get it from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/default.aspx">Roy Osherove's blog</a>.<br /><br />Update: Roy (thankfully) realized his naming error and renamed it as <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/Iserializable/%7E3/120448975/key-jedi-1-03-renamed-from-shortwatcher.aspx">Key Jedi</a>
