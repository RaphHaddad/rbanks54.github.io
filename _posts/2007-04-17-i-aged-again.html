<p>Yep, I've aged again.&nbsp; My birthday passed on the weekend and I had a great time.&nbsp; Quite a few presents from my girls, visits from relatives throughout the day, a cake at work today.&nbsp; It's all good.</p> <p>Being a game player I was quite happy to pick up 2 new titles for my Wii - <a href="http://www.easports.com/ssxblur/">SSX Blur</a> and <a href="http://www.electronicarts.com.au/en-au/games/wii/tigerwoods/tiger/">Tiger Woods 2007</a>.</p> <p>I've got to say, I'm really happy with both titles.&nbsp; SSX is lots of fun; a really good&nbsp;game&nbsp;and Tiger Woods was even better - I played against my father in law and he really got into it.&nbsp; The swing motion with the Wiimote in T/W is really good and improves a lot on the controls in Wii Sports.&nbsp; The Wii Sports golf was quite fiddly when it came to short puts and it's sometimes hard to register a small swing without whacking the ball past the hole.&nbsp; On Tiger you just swing normally and never have the troubles of trying to register really small movements with the Wiimote.</p> <p>Also on the Wii - I saw an article on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=amWmy6_JG16U&amp;refer=home">Bloomberg</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.australiangamer.com/index.php?id=20070401#comment448">Australian Gamer</a> for the link) talking about game makers ignoring the Wii and now being in a complete panic trying to get titles onto the platform as soon as humanly possible.&nbsp; The thing that surprised me was the sales figures...</p> <p>US &amp; Japan Sales for Jan/Feb</p> <blockquote> <p>Wii: 1,470,000<br>PS3: 604,331<br>XBox 360: 584,329</p></blockquote> <p>The Wii outsold the other 2 platforms combined, by almost 300,000 units!</p> <p>And as for the statement that the "Wii appears to be expanding the market, rather than stealing sales from rivals"; I can vouch for that.&nbsp; When I see my in-laws playing computer games, having fun and wanting to play more I know it's the Wii that does it - the same game on the PC or XBox wouldn't have any interest to them at all.</p>
