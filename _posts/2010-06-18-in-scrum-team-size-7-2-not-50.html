<p>I was talking to someone yesterday telling me about her previous employer and the scrum team they had.&#160; I almost fell over when she said they had 50 people on their team at the time.&#160; Surely that was 6 or 7 smaller teams right? No – just one team.</p>  <p>In fact there were so many people at the daily stand up that they used to pass around a microphone so everyone could hear!&#160; However, things weren’t quite as bad as I might think because of pair programming.&#160; Only one person in two actually had to talk because the second person in each pair would’ve just said the same as the first.&#160; What about rotating pairs during the day? And even then, 25 people in a team is too large.&#160; At that size it’s not a team anymore – it’s just a crowd.</p>  <p>Remember, it’s 7 plus or minus 2 for the ideal scrum team size.&#160; Not 50!</p>
