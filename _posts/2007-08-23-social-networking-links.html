I've resisted adding the social networking links to my site in the past because I don't want each post to look like a billboard for other sites.  (Yes, I've got a little bit of google advertising going on, but that's just to pay for my <a href="http://www.lotro.com">lotro</a> habit and it doesn't exactly pay the bills).<br /><br />Recently I'm starting to find these things useful so I've added a few easy links to add my posts to the social networking site of your choice.  Personally I'm now using <a href="http://rbanks54.stumbleupon.com">stumbleupon</a>, but because of the popularity of Digg and Facebook I've added those as well.<br /><br />Hopefully this won't detract too much from the overall experience of the site, but if it does, let me know and I'll get rid of them in a flash.
