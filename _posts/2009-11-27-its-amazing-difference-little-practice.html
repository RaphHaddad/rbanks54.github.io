<p>A few days ago I wrote about <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2009/11/are-code-katas-new-bright-and-shiny.html" target="_blank">code katas</a> and the poor effort I thought the first one was for me and how eye opening that was.&#160; Well that effort has spurred me on to improve myself and I’ve stuck with it over the last few days by going through the kata a number of times on train trips and late at night trying to improve the time it takes and how efficiently I can get to done and now I’m able to run through the kata in a matter of minutes, as you can see here.</p>  <p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jb3_yiARyic&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jb3_yiARyic&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>  <p>As you can also see, I still make plenty of mistakes in my typing, I think I make better use ReSharper and I tend to type out variable names long hand instead of relying on auto completion to help me out.&#160; To that end I’ve still got a ways to go to get it right but even so it’s a big improvement on the first run.&#160; And if you’re wondering, I’ve put the video here not to boast, but to act as a baseline against which to measure my improvement over time and also so I can get feedback from you for further improvement.&#160; So, what else can I do to improve?&#160; What other mistakes am I making?&#160; I’d like to know.</p>
