I've just finished delivering my Microservices talk at DDD Sydney and promised the folks a few links so they could look back on things and get some ideas for their own projects.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TyREA1afUdQ/V0kvapW2KEI/AAAAAAAABuM/0zom-lUAqhYKs3rP6vtPxEJz1_1Q4nO6ACLcB/s1600/WP_20160528_006.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TyREA1afUdQ/V0kvapW2KEI/AAAAAAAABuM/0zom-lUAqhYKs3rP6vtPxEJz1_1Q4nO6ACLcB/s640/WP_20160528_006.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Before that, a big thanks to everyone in the audience who came along and asked questions. We covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time!<br /><br />Remember that the code in the GitHub repo is for inspiration, not duplication and there is some incomplete code in the repo (sorry about that). &nbsp;The slides have plenty of bullet points and notes so you can come back and look at things after the fact, and use it as a reference.<br /><br />Here's the links:<br />GitHub repo:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/rbanks54/microcafe">https://github.com/rbanks54/microcafe</a><br />Slides:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rbanks54/architecting-microservices-in-net">http://www.slideshare.net/rbanks54/architecting-microservices-in-net</a>
