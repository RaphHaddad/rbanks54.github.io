<p>Last night I did a presentation on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx">Rhino Mocks 3.5</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://sydneyaltdotnet.blogspot.com/">Sydney ALT.NET user group</a>.&nbsp; I demoed the new AAA syntax (arrange, act, assert) as well as doing a run through of some of the more advanced usages of Rhino such as using mocks to test events and event handlers, the ability to throw exceptions to see how your class handles them and the use of Rhino from VB.NET.</p> <p>A big thank you to everyone who came and made it such a great evening.</p> <p>P.S. The demo project I used last night is available for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/richardsbraindump/web/Rhino%203.5.zip?hl=en">download here</a>.</p>
