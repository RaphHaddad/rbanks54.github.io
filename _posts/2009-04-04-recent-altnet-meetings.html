<p>It’s been a busy time for me this week just gone.&nbsp; I presented (well, it was really more a case of leading and guiding a discussion) at two alt.net meetings this week.</p> <p>The first was the <a href="http://ozalt.net" target="_blank">Australian Virtual Alt.Net</a> meeting that happens every fortnight on a Monday, and the second was at the <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net" target="_blank">Sydney Alt.Net</a> user group meeting on Tuesday.</p> <p>The <a href="http://ozalt.net" target="_blank">Virtual Alt.Net</a> meeting was on BDD and the recording of the event is available on <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/rbanks/videos/3/" target="_blank">Viddler</a> (and embedded here for your ease).&nbsp; We talked about what BDD is, how it differs from TDD and unit testing in general, some of the tools you can use with it, and then we went into a bit of a demo of how you can work with BDD today using nothing more than the existing xUnit tools that are already in common use in most organisations today.</p> <p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler_rbanks_3"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/1db27ee9/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/1db27ee9/" wmode="transparent" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler_rbanks_3" /></embed></object>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net" target="_blank">Sydney Alt.Net</a> meeting we had an <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/2009/04/march-open-spaces-wrap-up.html" target="_blank">open spaces evening</a> in which I talked about the upcoming code contracts functionality in .NET 4.0, and showed how you can use that functionality today with VS2008.&nbsp; Unfortunately I didn’t manage to get a screen cast of the talk but never fear! The content was based largely off a blog post I did earlier on the subject <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2009/02/code-contracts.html" target="_blank">which you can find here</a>.</p> <p>As a side note I did an experimental live web cast of the other sessions from the meeting using <a href="http://kyte.tv/rbanks54" target="_blank">Kyte.tv</a> over a 3g connection.&nbsp; It worked surprisingly well, though at times the sound isn’t too great – but I suppose that’s an issue with webcam mics in general.&nbsp; Anyway, if you’re interested go <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/270711-rbanks54/392343-altnet-march-09-open-spaces" target="_blank">check out</a> <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/270711-rbanks54/392346-altnet-march-09" target="_blank">the recordings</a>.</p>
