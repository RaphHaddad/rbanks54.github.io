<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/frankarr/default.aspx">Frank Arrigo</a> has <a title="End of a Craxy Day" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/frankarr/archive/2006/12/21/end-of-a-crazy-day.aspx">blogged</a> that he had a "crazy day" where he started at 8AM and didn't finish until 6PM, that he grabbed some food on the go and didn't even get to write a blog entry.&nbsp; Fair enough.</p> <p>But since the hours mentioned are a normal day for me (I'm usually here at or before 8AM and leave about 6 to 6:30 including working through lunch) it made me wonder what most people think of as a normal day and what things in a day constitute a crazy day.&nbsp; For me a crazy day is one where I bounce from one thing to another with no mental downtime between and where there is a high demand for critical thinking and clear decision making.&nbsp; Constant task switching between often completely different things with no in between time to get my brain in gear or to spend with my team is usually what frazzles me.</p> <p>For my teams, they&nbsp;start around 8:30, have the scrum daily stand-up meetings at 9AM.&nbsp; Most people will take a decent break for lunch (Sydney has plenty of lunch time distractions) though a number often work through so they don't <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">break</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000691.html">out of</a> the <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taouu/html/ch04s05.html">zone</a> or so they can complete a feature, and a majority will go home around 5:30PM or shortly thereafter.&nbsp; Since they are all "knowledge workers" involved in concentration based activities I have no problem with this, and it lines up with my philosophy of having a life outside of work.</p> <p>But what about people like myself who spend most of the day communicating with other people or involved in other management activities?&nbsp; What of the Scrum Masters, the Product Owners and the various other I.T. disciplines like DBA's, I.T. support, network technicians, etc.&nbsp;</p> <p>What sort of day is it that makes you get home and go "ploomp" on the couch in front of the TV?</p>
