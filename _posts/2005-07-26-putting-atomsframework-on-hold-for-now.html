I've decided to put the <a href="http://jcframework.sourceforge.net">AtomsFramework</a> (the open source object/relational persistence framework) on hold for the next 6 months or so, and to then decide what to do with it after that.<br /><br />This has been a difficult decision, since there is a lot of pride and effort invested in the software, but in my new role as the development manager for a rapidly expanding software company, I've found that there are a number of large problems I've must devote my time and energy to, and this means that having time for an open source project would mean I'd be sacrificing the time I spend with my family.<br /><br />In the mean time, if there are any volunteers who wish to take up the baton and keep the AtomsFramework moving forward, please let me know.   Alternatively, have a look at some of the other open source O/R frameworks such as <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> or <a href="http://www.mertner.com/confluence/display/Gentle/Home">Gentle.NET</a>.
