<p>So you might have heard that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeplex.com/oxite">Oxite</a> was released recently.&nbsp; You know the one – it’s the all new, all shiny, singing and dancing blog engine that is meant to show off how great ASP.NET MVC apps should be built.&nbsp; The system used to run the <a target="_blank" href="http://visitmix.com/">MIX</a> web site.&nbsp; Yeah, that’s the one.&nbsp; And it’s meant to be a great example of good architecture, appropriate use of design patterns and clean code as well, isn’t it?  <p>Hmmm.&nbsp; It appears not.&nbsp; Check out this review by Karl… <p><a target="_blank" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2008/12/15/oxite-oh-dear-lord-why.aspx">http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2008/12/15/oxite-oh-dear-lord-why.aspx</a>  <p>It’s quotes like this that worry me: “Actually, I seriously think I'm missing a project, because there's no way the team built all this functionality and only 51 tests - apologies if I'm missing a part of the project” or this comment from a review on the project’s Codeplex site - “You have three total test classes, and one test class that is 1400 lines long.”&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; Shouldn’t testing and quality be a prime concern of a well written project?&nbsp; I would have thought so. <p>All I can say at the moment is “Ouch!”&nbsp; Now in all fairness I haven’t seen the code myself yet so I’m going to download it and have a look at the code myself and make up my own mind.&nbsp; You should too, and when you do see if you can spot why some people are ripping into it as (yet another) really bad Microsoft example of how to develop applications.</p>
