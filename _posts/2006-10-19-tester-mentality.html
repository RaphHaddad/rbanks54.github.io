OK, so he's a wierd looking chap, but he knows what he's talking about.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/micahel/default.aspx">The Braidy Tester</a> has a little blog post about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/micahel/archive/2006/10/18/tester-mentality.aspx">mentality a tester must have</a>.<br /><br />Guess what - it's not just about proving something doesn't crash, but also about making sure it's good for the customer.<br /><br />Thinking about the customer doesn't just apply to testers and testing though, it also applies to the rest of us in our design, UI, code, support, and the other activities we do and is one of the foundations of any agile methodology.
