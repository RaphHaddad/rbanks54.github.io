<p>Why? Because that’s the session you want to go to of course!</p>  <p>Here’s the link with all the details: <a href="http://australia.msteched.com/topic/details/DEV305">http://australia.msteched.com/topic/details/DEV305</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.aaron-powell.com/">Aaron Powell</a>, <a href="http://lzcd.com/">Luke Drumm</a>, <a href="http://azure.snagy.name/blog/">Steve Nagy</a> and myself are going to show you how to build applications for the cloud using multiple clients (i.e. PC and Windows Phone 7 in this case) and some of the things to watch out for.&#160; Don’t worry it won’t be one of those sessions where people try and prove how awesome they are by writing the whole thing on stage.&#160; Instead we’ll be showing you the highlights and what you should think about if you want to try something similar.</p>  <p>I’ll also have my recording equipment with me and will be recording a number of podcasts for <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/">Talking Shop Down Under</a> with people while I’m up there, so if you want to hear from someone in particular, let me know so I can line up a time with them!</p>
