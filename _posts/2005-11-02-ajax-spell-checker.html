I've been looking at incorporating a spell checker into an ASP.NET application on and off for a while, but could never really find anything that was suitable - either there are popup pages involved, or it was all client side validation which meant dictionaries had to live on the client machine to be useful.
<br />
<br />I've just run across an AJAX based spell checker at <a href="http://www.broken-notebook.com/spell_checker/index.php">broken-notebook</a> that looks the goods.  It's in PHP, but I'm sure it won't take long to knock into shape as an ASP.NET page.
<br />
<br />I'll post some results here soon.
