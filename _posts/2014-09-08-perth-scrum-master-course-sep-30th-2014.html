This one is mainly for the Perth people (Hi Perth!).<br /><br />I'll be coming your way on Sep 30th &amp; Oct 1st to deliver a Scrum.org <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Courses/Professional-Scrum-Master">Professional Scrum Master</a> course.<br /><br />Usually I deliver private Scrum training, so a public course for is enough of a rarity that I thought I'd mention it here so people know about it.<br /><br />Mentioned! Job done. Wasn't that easy? :-)<br /><br />Now you just need to do you part and register by using the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/professional-scrum-master-course-perth-tickets-12823658909">registration link</a>.&nbsp;Do that and I'll see you there.<br /><br />P.S. I'll be missing the <a href="http://perthdotnet.blogspot.com.au/">Perth .NET Community of Practice</a> meetup by just a day, but if people want an after hours catch up while I'm in town, let me know.
