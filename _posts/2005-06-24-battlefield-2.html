I just (well, last night actually) picked up my preorder for <a href="http://www.eagames.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/home.jsp">Battlefield 2</a>.  First impressions were very good and led to a very late night!<br /><br />The graphics are better, the gameplay better, the whole thing is better!  All the good bits provided by the <a href="http://www.desertcombat.com/">Desert Combat</a> guys are there as well, along with a nice new ranking system.  You play as squad leaders, generals, grunts, whatever.<br /><br />If you liked <a href="http://www.eagames.com/official/battlefield/1942/us/">BF1942</a>, or DC then go out and pick this baby up.
