<p>I'll be presenting a free session on agile development and what it looks like from a .NET developers point of view as part of the free <a href="http://www.readify.net/rdn.aspx" target="_blank">Readify Developer Network</a> events we regularly hold around the country (Sydney, Canberra &amp; Melbourne).&nbsp; If you're not still on holidays between Jan 15 - 17 (<a href="http://www.readify.net/rdncalendar.aspx" target="_blank">check the RDN calendar</a>) then register now, put the date in your diary and I'll see you then.</p> <p>Oh, don't forget to bring your questions.&nbsp; The more interactive we can be then the more value you should get from it!</p>
