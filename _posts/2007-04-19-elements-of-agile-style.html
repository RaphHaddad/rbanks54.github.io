<p><a href="http://agileconsortium.blogspot.com/">Joseph Little</a> has started to put together a handbook on agile called <a href="http://agileconsortium.pbwiki.com/The%20Elements%20of%20Agile%20Style">The Elements of Agile Style</a>.  It's still in draft format and it's reasonably comprehensive.  It touches on all the main areas of agile at a high level and includes references to more detailed information should you want to delve into a particular area.</p><p>It's worth checking out and you should feel free post comments for Joseph.  I'm sure he'd love to have feedback.</p>
