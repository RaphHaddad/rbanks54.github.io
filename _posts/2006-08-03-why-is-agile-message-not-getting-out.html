There was a post on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scrumdevelopment/">scrumdevelopment mailing list</a> asking why the agile message was not being picked up as clearly as we wish.  Why do people not "<span style="font-style: italic;">get it</span>"?<br /><br />The problem as I see it  is to do with the fundamental differences in the principles underlying both  waterfall and agile development.  It's the difference between  management and leadership - both of which are terms bandied about interchangeably by people who don't often understand the difference.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Management</span> is directing & controlling a process (ie having control)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leadership</span> is  influencing & trusting people (ie releasing  control)<br /><br />There's an <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> describing the principles behind agile projects.  I think a "Waterfall Manifesto" would be something like<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Process & tools </span> over individuals &amp; interactions</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Following a plan</span> over  responding to change</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Contract negotiation  & self-protection</span> over collaboration &amp;  trust</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Comprehensive  documentation</span> over useful software</li></ul><br />Waterfall = Management<br />Agile =  Leadership<br /><br />Leadership is a helluva  lot harder than management, especially for techies-turned-bosses.  Let's face it  soft skills are hard to teach and people are such unpredictable things!  ;-)
