<p>Just a reminder of a few things happening next week.</p> <p>First, there is a Scrum gathering on Monday night - <a title="http://www.scrum.com.au/2008/08/25/sydney-scrum-users-get-together-september-1" href="http://www.scrum.com.au/2008/08/25/sydney-scrum-users-get-together-september-1">http://www.scrum.com.au/2008/08/25/sydney-scrum-users-get-together-september-1</a> and it looks like the <a href="http://blog.syxpac.org/" target="_blank">Syxpac</a> user group will also be joining us.&nbsp; It should be a fun night.</p> <p>Secondly, <a href="http://aunz.msteched.com/" target="_blank">Tech.Ed Australia</a> starts on Wednesday.</p> <p>If you're interested in seeing my session on building loosely coupled applications with Unity (ARC304), it's on Thursday at 11:45.&nbsp; If you just want to catch up with me feel free to get in touch via the connect site, or email me.</p> <p>It should be a long, tiring, enjoyable week :-)</p>
