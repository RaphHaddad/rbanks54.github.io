<p>The first Oz Alt.Net virtual meeting happened tonight and I found it really enjoyable.&nbsp; It was great to have a lot of conversation and chit chat happening between the attendees, and fantastic to see people from all across the country being able to talk with each other.&nbsp; It really surprised me just how quickly the time went once the conversation started flowing, which is obviously a good sign.</p> <p>Anyway, if you couldn’t make it or you use a Mac (sorry, I don’t think live meeting will work for you) then feel free to check out the recording that’s been posted on the main <a href="http://ozalt.net" target="_blank">ozalt.net</a> site at <a title="http://ozalt.net/blog/virtual-alt-net-3-feb-09/" href="http://ozalt.net/blog/virtual-alt-net-3-feb-09/">http://ozalt.net/blog/virtual-alt-net-3-feb-09/</a></p>
