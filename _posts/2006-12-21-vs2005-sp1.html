Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 is available for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/vs2005sp1/default.aspx">download</a> (just in case you weren't aware) and at a hefty 440 Mb it certainly takes a while to get it.  But if you think the download takes a while, wait until you try the installation.  Man-oh-man! What an ordeal - over 2 hours for the installation, and heavy on the CPU the entire time.  I really have to wonder what it's doing under the hood!<br /><br />Anyhoo in case you want to see what's new check out <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/12/15/visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1-sp1-released.aspx">Scott Gu's blog</a> (with <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/12/16/installing-vs-2005-sp1-on-vista-and-how-to-uninstall-the-vs-2005-sp1-beta-on-vista.aspx">Vista install tips</a>) or the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/vs2005sp1/default.aspx">download</a> page.  Even though the install is lengthy it's worth the wait.
