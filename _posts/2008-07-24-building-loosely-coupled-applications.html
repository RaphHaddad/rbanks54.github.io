<p>I've been fortunate enough to be given a speaking slot at Microsoft Tech.Ed Australia this year and I'll be doing a session on using Unity - the new IoC container included with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/entlib" target="_blank">Enterprise Library v4.0</a>.</p> <p>Here's the session extract from the <a href="https://aunz.msteched.com/au/public/sessions.aspx" target="_blank">Tech.Ed Australia Session Catalogue</a>:</p> <p><em>"Loosely coupled applications. We all want them, yet the reality of what we build is usually so far removed from that goal.&nbsp; Come and see how the Unity container and the inversion of control &amp; dependency injection patterns can help you architect applications that are not only free of tight class couplings but have the added advantage of being easier to test.&nbsp; Techniques for breaking dependencies in existing code will also be covered."</em></p> <p>If you're coming to Tech.Ed I hope I'll see you there!</p> <p>P.S. There's plenty of other reasons to go to Tech.Ed (other than me of course) with a host of speakers from Redmond, including Scott Hanselman, and a squad of current and former Redifarians: <a href="http://notgartner.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mitch Denny</a>, <a href="http://www.acorns.com.au/Blog/" target="_blank">Corneliu Tusnea</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/pglavich/" target="_blank">Paul Glavich</a>, <a href="http://www.paulstovell.com/blog/" target="_blank">Paul Stovell</a>, <a href="http://blog.tatham.oddie.com.au/" target="_blank">Tatham Oddie</a>, <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/greg_low/" target="_blank">Greg Low</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.biztalkbill.com/" target="_blank">Bill Chesnut</a></p>
