Now this is a tempting distraction...  <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/06/27/wiiware/">The Wii is being opened up</a> to the mass market of independent developers who want to write mini-games, tinker or just have fun.<br /><br />It's called WiiWare and there's a <a href="http://press.nintendo.com/articles.jsp?id=12571">press statement</a> from Nintendo about it.<br /><br />I'll be really curious to see how this pans out.  Oh, and apparently worldwide sales of the Wii have hit <a href="http://www.vgchartz.com/hwcomps.php">8.5 million</a> - only 1.5 million behind the XBox 360 - it's a huge installed base considering the platforms only been on sale six months.
