Thanks to <a href="http://800ceoread.com/blog/archives/006931.html">800-CEO-READ</a> I just read <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/05/01/8405654/index.htm?postversion=2007042407">Business 2.0 article</a> about Nintendo's recovery and their return to completely dominate sales for the current generation of consoles.<br /><br />It's a very interesting read in terms of strategy, marketing, learning from your mistakes and being willing to take big risks.  After all if the <a href="http://wii.com/">Wii</a> failed then <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/home">Nintendo</a> might well have pulled out of consoles and just concentrated on hand-held gaming.  And when you consider that the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/channel/ds">DS</a> was a huge risk for them as well then they've made 2 bet-the-business gambles in the last 5 years.<br /><br />Anyone who's read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Companies/dp/0060566108/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7899244-9103848?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1177722774&sr=8-1">Built to Last</a> will recognize that Nintendo has exhibited many of the traits of visionary companies.<br /><br />Nintendo has stuck with their core ideology (interactive entertainment), they focus on customers over profits (gameplay comes first), they've made huge gambles (DS &amp; Wii), they've kept leadership promotions internal (Hiroshi Yamauchi - 1950, Satoru Iwata - 2002), were willing to change with the times, and they've tried a bunch of things and kept what works ("game & watch" was a success; gamecube was a failure).<br /><br />In fact Nintendo <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/corp/history.jsp">corporate history</a> shows that big gambles, trying stuff, etc are a part of their corporate culture, and for a company that was founded in 1889, I suppose it was only a matter of time before they bounced back.
