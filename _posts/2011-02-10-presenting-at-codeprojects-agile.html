<p>The title does give it away a little I suppose…&#160; I’ll be presenting two sessions at the <a href="http://www.virtualtechsummits.com/Register.aspx?eventID=7" target="_blank">Agile Virtual Tech Summit</a> run by the Code Project.&#160; I’m quite honoured to be asked to present and for reference in my 2 sessions I’ll be keynoting the Agile track with a talk on Agile from a Developers Perspective, with the other session being about Lessons Learned from Agile Implementations.</p>  <p>You can <a href="http://www.virtualtechsummits.com/Register.aspx?eventID=7" target="_blank">register for the free event</a> on the site and the summit will get underway on Feb 23rd, 2011 at 12pm ET (for those in Australia that’s a 4AM start on the 24th so don’t forget the coffee!)</p>
