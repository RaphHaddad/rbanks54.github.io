<p>Are you an Aussie dev? Based in Sydney or somewhere within driving/flying distance?</p>  <p>Well, why don’t you get yourself along to DDD Sydney this year? Not only will you have a chance to hear me wax lyrical about Comet&#160; with IIS and how async coding can help improve performance, but you’ll also get to partake of a slew, nay a plethora!, of topics from other great speakers.</p>  <p>Apart from my talk, I’ll also be a panellist for the Open Source panel, and I’m facilitating the Web Panel later in the day, so at least you now know which sessions to avoid, right? :-)</p>  <p>Jokes aside, last years DDD Sydney was a lot of fun and this year will be even bigger – the <a href="http://www.dddsydney.com/agenda.aspx">agenda</a> and <a href="http://www.dddsydney.com/Registration.aspx">registration</a> are now available.&#160; Go check out the details, book yourself a ticket, and I’ll see you there!</p>
