<p>It’s useful to take time to reflect on why you do the things you do.  Today I took a little of that time and decided to look once again at the original post that Dave Laribee wrote when coining the term Alt.Net.  It’s a great reminder of what Alt.Net is all about and why I’m involved in it – in fact, if you haven’t read it go to <a href="http://laribee.com/blog/2007/04/10/altnet/" target="_blank">http://laribee.com/blog/2007/04/10/altnet/</a> and have a look for yourself.  Right now.  Go on!  You can always navigate back here when you’re done.</p> <p>Specifically, Dave writes this: <em>When tools, practices, or methods become mainstream it’s time to get contrarian; time to look for new ways of doing things; time to shake it up.</em></p> <p>So ask yourself this question: <strong>What am I doing to either make my current “contrarian” tools, practices and methods mainstream?  And what am I doing to innovate and improve the practices, tools and methods I use that I consider mainstream?</strong></p> <p>It’s something to think about, isn’t it :-)</p>
