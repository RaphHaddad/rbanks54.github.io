Oh No!!  <a href="http://www.charliedigital.com/PermaLink,guid,95b2ab68-ba92-413a-b758-2783cde5df9c.aspx">NDoc 2.0 has died</a> due to lack of support (read the post).<br /><br />And now I feel kinda guilty as well.  I used <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> to generate the reference guide for the <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/jcframework">AtomsFramework</a>, and for other non-O/S projects as well.<br /><br />I really feel for Kevin.  I know personally how much time I spent getting the <a href="http://jcframework.sf.net/">AtomsFramework</a> up and running, supporting others who used it, and so forth.  Of the almost 13,000+ downloads and with it being used in a number of live projects around the world I recieved a total of 1 donation.  That's a pretty poor hit rate.<br /><br />Yet at the same time I ask myself how many contributions have I made to open source?  I can think of none.  I know I've paid for shareware, but not for O/S.  Why?  Probably because it didn't really occur to me at the time.  I download something to see if it works.  If it doesn't I ingore it, if it does I just use it - forgetting to go back to the creators and give them a tip.<br /><br />Having said that I guess that I did feel a little let down by the lack of financial thankyou's.  And I can empathise with Kevin deeply.  NDoc has been downloaded 13,000,000 times.  If Kevin recieved 1 donation for every 13,000 downloads (which is my ratio) that would have been 1,000 donations.  At an average of say $10 per donation it's still a pretty poor return.  $10,000 for something used by well over 1,000,000 developers and extremely well known world wide is laughable.<br /><br />Imagine if he charged $25 per seat and sold _only_ 130,000 copies (1%).  He would have made over $3 million dollars!!<br /><br />We really do need to support open source financially.  I'm using <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a> now for a project so  I guess it's time to pull out the wallet and cough up some cash.
