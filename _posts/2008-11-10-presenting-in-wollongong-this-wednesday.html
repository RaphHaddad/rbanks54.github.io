<p>For those of you in Wollongong (and the deep south of Sydney) I'll be presenting at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdnug.org.au/">Wollongong .NET User Group</a> this Wednesday on Agile Development.&nbsp; I like my agile sessions to be very interactive so if you're going to be there make sure you bring along your questions and we'll have a great chat and a good, fun evening together.</p> <p>I'll see you there!</p> <p>P.S. More details can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdnug.org.au/Default.aspx?tabid=81&amp;newsType=ArticleView&amp;articleId=124">user group web site</a></p>
