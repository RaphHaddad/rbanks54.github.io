<p>For those of you using NUnit with TFS you may want to go and visit the <a href="http://codeplex.com/nunit4teambuild" target="_blank">NUnit4TeamBuild project site</a> on CodePlex and get the latest release.</p> <p>It fixes some issues with support NUnit 2.5 and test names longer than 255 characters, but most importantly it removes the need to have MSTest available for publishing the results back to the TFS server through the inclusion of a new utility that makes the appropriate WCF calls directly instead of doing so through the MSTest executable.</p> <p>Many thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/mrkwatkins" target="_blank">Kev Watkins</a> for the contribution! I love seeing open source working so well :-)</p> <p>For more info on how the whole thing works go and see <a href="http://www.mrkwatkins.co.uk/Blog/2009/07/25/Making-NUnit-Play-Nicely-With-Team-Foundation-Server" target="_blank">Kev Watkins blog post</a> or visit the <a href="http://codeplex.com/nunit4teambuild" target="_blank">project site</a>.</p>
