Following on from PDC Microsoft normally makes a bunch of technologies available for download.  This time it's no different.<br /><br />They have just made Team Foundation Server Beta 3 available for download from the MSDN subscribers site.<br /><br />They have also made the Visual Studio 2005 Release Candidate available as well.<br /><br />The best thing about the TFS Beta 3 can be used in production and it is supported through to the release.  According to an <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/default.aspx">article</a> on the MSDN site: "<em>Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server Beta 3 can now be used in a production environment. Microsoft is committed to supporting a complete migration from Beta 3 to the final RTM version of Team Foundation Server. Details of the Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server Beta 3 Go-Live license will be forthcoming. </em>"<br /><br />Time to get a download happening...
