At the moment I'm kicking back on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&amp;q=runaway+bay,+queensland,+australia&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=25.576952,58.710937&ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=16&ll=-27.917753,153.396714&amp;spn=0.013879,0.035706&t=k&amp;om=1">Gold Coast</a> and having a very relaxing and lazy time.  For instance today I've been out on a boat for a while, watched <a href="http://www.happyfeetmovie.com/">Happy Feet</a> with the kids, played a bit of <a href="http://www.zelda.com/universe/game/legendzelda/">Zelda</a>, read a bit of <a href="http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/books/default.aspx?id=23950">"Into a Dark Realm"</a> and basically done not much of anything.<br /><br />Last night, the family went to the <a href="http://www.outbackspectacular.com.au/">Outback Spectacular</a> near <a href="http://www.wetnwild.com.au/">Wet 'n Wild</a> - and it was a fantastic night.  Great food, top notch show, and some awesome equestrian skills on display.  If you get a chance to go, I'd recommend taking it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/341789093/" title="Photo Sharing" style="float: right;"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/126/341789093_91942cd0f3_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="P1010016" /></a>This holiday I've also taken along the <a href="http://www.wii.com/"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Wii</span></a> so I could have a play with some of my <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Christmas</span> presents.  As it turns out, the rest of the extended family has gotten hooked on it.  <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/software_wiisports.jsp"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Wii</span> Sports</a> in particular has really hit the sweet spot for people - from my kids through to their grandparents; everyone is playing and everyone is having a great time.  Normally I'm the only one who plays games, but with the <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Wii</span> not only can everyone play but everyone wants to!  So much so that I've gone out looking for two more remotes so that we can have 4 player games and one of the other people has decided to get one for themselves as soon as they get home.<br /><br />The holiday continues for another week and I'm off to <a href="http://www.dreamworld.com.au/content/home_v4.asp?">Dreamworld</a> and <a href="http://www.seaworld.com.au/home/homepage.cfm">Sea World</a> in the next few days, as well as catching the fireworks for New Years Eve tomorrow.<br /><br />2006 has been a big year, and I'm sure 2007 will be even bigger!  Happy new year to all!
