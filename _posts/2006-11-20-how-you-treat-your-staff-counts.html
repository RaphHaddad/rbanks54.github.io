...Especially when popular blogs like <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> gets into your training facilities and notices how (not) current your <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/11/how_will_sun_bo.html">employee of the quarter board</a> is.<br /><br />I tell you, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/employeeofthequarterflat.jpg">that</a> made me chuckle :-)<br /><br />And then I had to stop and think.  How well am I treating my staff?  Thankfully I'm in the middle of informal reviews with them all and when I ask them "is there anything they need from me that I'm not doing?" the answer is usually nothing.  Which either means I've beaten them into submission in true Orwellian fashion, or they're being treated OK.<br /><br />Of course that doesn't mean I can't do better, but at least they're not going to lynch me when I'm not looking!!
