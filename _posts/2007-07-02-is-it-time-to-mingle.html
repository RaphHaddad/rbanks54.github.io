In a previous post I talked about the <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2007/06/4-invaluable-scrum-tools.html">4 tools you need</a> for managing an Agile project, and how lo-tech those solutions are.  While I stand behind that approach, there is often a need to electronically manage that process and for me that tool would normally be Excel (or Google).<br /><br />Well, Thoughtworks have just released a product called <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a> that looks to offer the same flexibility as a "Post-It notes and a wall" solution in electronic form.  It's an interesting offering and I'm keen to see it in action.  The offering itself is a subscription based pricing, but if your a community or small teams (5 people or less) it's free.  Considering that the competition to the software is a pen and paper offering it's a price point that makes sense.<br /><br />I've just registered for early access and hopefully I'll be able to get a hold of this and compare it to other tools I've looked at previously.  But let me reiterate - you should get your agile process right using lo-tech means before investing in any tools.  Remember that any tool should be used to support your process; not a means of defining it.
