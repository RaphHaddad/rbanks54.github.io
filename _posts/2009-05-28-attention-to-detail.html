<p>Sometimes you just have to wonder how the things that show a lack of attention to detail can make it to production.&nbsp; Especially when there are sooo many eyeballs that would have looked over something before it’s release.</p> <p>Notice anything suspect about the latest Zune HD marketing shots?&nbsp; Hint: It’s inside the circled area :-)</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/Sh5JBOIsdFI/AAAAAAAAAog/1h8s5w-EtwU/s1600-h/image%5B2%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/Sh5JCWR474I/AAAAAAAAAok/R3BEYDtXVMQ/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="464" height="346"></a> </p> <p>A font clipping problem? Seriously?! Why wouldn’t you just reduce the font size by a tiny fraction so that the default text actually fits cleanly.&nbsp; It’s not that hard a problem surely?&nbsp; And now that I’ve seen that I’m wondering if the device is actually too narrow and whether other software will also experience the same clipping problem.</p> <p>And then I start wondering, why on earth would you use an image with clipping problems as a promotional picture?&nbsp; I can’t imaging Apple letting something like that slip through.</p>
