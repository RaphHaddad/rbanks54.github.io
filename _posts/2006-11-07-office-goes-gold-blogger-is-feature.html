Looks like it's the time of year when new versions of products start getting wrapped up.<br /><br />Office 2007 has made it to RTM stage. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/06/office-2007-released-to-manufacturing.aspx">Read the blog post here</a>. It will be available to volume licensing customers by the end of the year and in retail stores in early 2007 and I'm planning on upgrading everyone shortly after it becomes available (though I might wait for Vista first).<br /><br />Also, Blogger have announced that their <a href="http://beta.blogger.com">beta</a> is now feature complete now that  they've added support for FTP based blogs.
