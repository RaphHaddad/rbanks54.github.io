You may have noticed that external links on <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com">this blog</a> now have a "preview" window attached to them (thanks to <a href="http://www.snap.com/about/spa1A.php">Snap!</a>) so you can get an idea of what the page is like that a link will take you to.<br /><br />Hopefully you like it and find it useful.  If you don't you can always turn the feature off by clicking the options link in the popup window and disabling it for this site (or all sites).
