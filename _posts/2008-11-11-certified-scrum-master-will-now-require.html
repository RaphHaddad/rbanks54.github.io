<p>One of the big gripes people have about the CSM (Certified Scrum Master) accreditation is that you can get your CSM simply by attending a 2 day training session.&nbsp; You could all but sleep through the course and still be certified.</p> <p>Well, <a target="_blank" href="http://danube.com/blog/michaeljames/the_scrummaster_certification_test">that's all about to change</a>.&nbsp; I had a heads up on this earlier this year and all I could say then was "Hallelujah!".&nbsp; My feelings now are still the same.&nbsp; It's a long overdue improvement to the certification process to require proof of knowledge and understanding by people being certified.</p> <p>The process itself will be fairly simple - a straight up multiple choice exam, but at least it ensures that people now have a minimum guaranteed level of understanding and that can only help improve the strength and integrity of the certification process overall.&nbsp; It's not a complete answer to the certification process but it's a step in the right direction, and that's what agile is all about :-)</p> <p>InfoQ also has some thoughts on this at <a title="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/11/scrum-certification-test" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/11/scrum-certification-test">http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/11/scrum-certification-test</a></p>
