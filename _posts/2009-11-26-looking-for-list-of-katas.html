<p>As a follow up to <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2009/11/are-code-katas-new-bright-and-shiny.html" target="_blank">yesterdays post about code katas</a> I’ve received a few questions on twitter about where to find katas to try.</p>  <p>Before giving you a list of resources, remember that you can always make your own – katas are about practicing techniques on a known problem.&#160; That said it’s often easier to work off a list of problems to give you some variety in your practice and help avoid boredom.</p>  <p>So here’s a list of sites with either katas or straight up coding challenges that you may find useful for your practices:</p>  <p><a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue" target="_blank">Coding Dojo Wiki – Kata Catalogue</a>    <br /><a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" target="_blank">Code Katas at Pragmatic Programmer</a>    <br /><a href="http://rubyquiz.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Quiz</a>    <br /><a href="http://rubyquiz.strd6.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Quiz (Newer ones)</a>    <br /><a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/" target="_blank">Katas at Software Craftsmanship</a></p>  <p>By the way, if you know of other good kata catalogues then feel free to add a comment with their locations.&#160; Enjoy!</p>
