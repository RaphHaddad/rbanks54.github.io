<p>I don't quite know what to make of this.&nbsp; There's a bloke named <a href="http://www.feltron.com/">Nicholas Feltron</a> who has made stats of everything he's done this year and then published it as an <a href="http://www.feltron.com/06report_index.html">annual report</a>.</p> <p>One one hand, it's a great example of communicating information and it's excellent design work.&nbsp; On the other hand it's scary as hell - I mean, who does that!&nbsp; Who keeps track of the hottest/coldest temperatures in places they've been.&nbsp; Every day.&nbsp; For a whole year!&nbsp; And who notes down when they get their first grey hair!&nbsp; Or the types of animals they've eaten.</p> <p>I really don't know what to think, and yet it's strangely compelling.&nbsp; Go check it out and let me know what your impressions are.</p>
