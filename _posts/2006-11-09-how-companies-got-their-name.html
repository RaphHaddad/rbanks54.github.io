There's a <a href="http://nirvanamusing.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-some-companies-got-their-name.html">cool little blog entry</a> I stumbled across recently about how companies got their name.  Here's a few  of the more interetsing one's<br /><br />Apache - its founders got started by applying patches to code written for NCSA's httpd daemon. The result was 'a patchy' server<br /><br />Apple - for the favourite fruit of co-founder Steve Jobs and/or for the time he worked at an apple orchard. He was three months late in filing a name for the business, and he threatened to call his company Apple Computer if his colleagues didn't suggest a better name by 5 p.m.<br /><br />Fanta - The name comes from the German word for imagination (Fantasie or Phantasie), because the inventors thought that imagination was needed to taste oranges from the strange mix.<br /><br />Pepsi   - Pepsi derives its name from (treatment of) dyspepsia, an intestinal ailment.<br /><br />There's more on the list and it's worth a read if this sort of thing interests you.
