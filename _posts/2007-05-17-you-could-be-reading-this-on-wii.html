Well, you could if you used the new Wii interface for the Google Reader.  It's _very_ experimental, but if you want to give it a shot go to <a href="http://reader.google.com/">reader.google.com</a> and try it out.<br /><br />Alternatively have a look at the <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/feed-your-television.html">blog entry</a> which has a video of it in action.
