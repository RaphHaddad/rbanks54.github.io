Wow - this blog just racked up it's 10,000th visit!  When I started it 2 years ago I never really thought I would get that many visits (or keep posting for this long either).<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who visits regularly, whether by <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/">visiting the site</a> or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/RichardsBraindump">subscribing to the feed</a>.  I know it's a crowded web out there so its an honour to know you take the time to read my ramblings.
