NDC Sydney, 2018 is on as I write this and yesterday I gave a talk titled "Reigniting your desire to improve"

I've embedded the slides here for you, and I'll do the same for the video once it's available.

Here's the abstract for the talk:

> "We're doing pretty well. There's not much to improve on" #sigh
>
> It's so, so easy to get improvement fatigue. To become overly familiar and comfortable with the little dysfunctions in how you and your team work. To stop improving and start missing out on the fresh ideas and experiments that could elevate your team beyond the level they're currently working at.
>
>Let's explore the common problems teams often become comfortable with, and ideas for addressing them. Let's explore what you could try that can help your team think differently, to challenge the status quo, and to help you and your team reinvigorate your desire to improve and to raise your game to the next level!

If you've ever been in a team that seems to have hit the wall, or you've hit the wall yourself then there may be something in this talk that you'll find helpful.
