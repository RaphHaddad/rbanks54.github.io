I just came across <a href="http://nunitasp.sourceforge.net/">NUnitAsp</a> while trying to find some way to unit test ASPX pages.  It seems to be a fairly comprehensive extension for <a href="http://nunit.sourceforge.net/">NUnit</a> and would fit right in.<br /><br />The only problem I've got so far is that it doesn't understand buttons that use Javascript in the submit instead of having a href reference.  This is fairly critical to my testing and basically means I can't use it.<br /><br />If anyone else knows of a good way to unit test ASP.NET please drop me a line.
