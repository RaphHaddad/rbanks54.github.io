<p>Of course you do. Everyone does.</p>  <p>The question is do you know who to talk to? Often the best person is someone outside of the situation you are in who can give you the perspective you don’t have and the ideas that you may not have come up with on your own.</p>  <p>Throughout my career leading teams there have been many times where I would’ve loved someone outside the company that I could freely talk to about what was happening and to have them poke holes in the approaches and decisions I was making, but I didn’t know who that could be.</p>  <p>I’ve been thinking about this scenario for a while and it’s time to do something about it.&#160; As a result I’m making myself available to technical leaders who want someone to confidentially bounce ideas off.&#160; No sales pitches, no hidden agendas.&#160; All I want is to build relationships and to genuinely help you come to the best decisions about the problems you have.&#160; I’m not going to tell you how to do your job or pretend to know all there is about the day-to-day realities of your environment but I will be someone you can chat to openly about what’s going on and what problems you are facing.</p>  <p>So if you’re located in Sydney and you hold some form of technical leadership role then please get in touch.&#160; The easiest way to do so is to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:richard.banks@readify.net">richard.banks@readify.net</a> or via twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54">@rbanks54</a>).</p>  <p>I’m looking forward to having a chat with you soon!</p>
