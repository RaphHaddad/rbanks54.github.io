The Sandcastle project team is obviously making good progress.  They recently released their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e82ea71d-da89-42ee-a715-696e3a4873b2&displaylang=en">latest CTP</a> and now they've been given an <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb608422.aspx">official home</a> on the Microsoft MSDN site.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Anand &amp; crew.
