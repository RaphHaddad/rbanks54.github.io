<p>I just noticed a post by Seth Godin riffing that <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/371788061/ads-are-the-new.html" target="_blank">Ads are the new online tip jar</a>.&nbsp; He says that "<strong>If you like what you're reading, click an ad to say thanks.</strong>" which resonates quite well with me because this is what I've started doing over the last few months.</p> <p>It doesn't take much to click an ad, wait for a page to load, then use the browser back button and get back to what you were doing.&nbsp; Takes a few seconds, and give the site creator something small in return.&nbsp; It's an easier system than Sourceforge's donation mechanism, or the many forms of micro-payments (which just never seem to take off) so for now, clicking ads seems to be the best option.</p> <p>Note: Whilst I do have ads on this site I don't want you to click them just because you read this post.&nbsp; I'm not trying to drum up revenue.</p>
