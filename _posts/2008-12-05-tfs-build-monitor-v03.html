<p>For those of you who are interested in having your very own continuous integration build light for TFS or want to be able to tweet build status information automatically, a new version of the TFS Build Monitor (formerly the Twitter Build Publisher) is now available from Codeplex at <a title="http://www.codeplex.com/BuildMonitor" href="http://www.codeplex.com/BuildMonitor">http://www.codeplex.com/BuildMonitor</a></p> <p>The changes in v0.3 are that the application is now a WPF application instead of a console app and it can be minimized to the system tray, thus keeping it out of your way when you're doing real work.</p> <p>There's also a few minor changes related to handling errors when the Delcom device isn't attached or when the TFS server can't be reached, etc.</p> <p>If you've got any problems - submit an issue on the codeplex site.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p>
