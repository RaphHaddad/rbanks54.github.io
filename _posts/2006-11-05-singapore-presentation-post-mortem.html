Well it took a little longer than expected but I'm finally putting down my thoughts on last weeks presentation.<br /><br />Firstly, from my perspective things went very well.  When you consider that I actually presented at 5:30 PM after a long day for the delegates, things went very, very well.  I got the message across, kept people awake and interested (people leaning forward in their seats, nodding their heads is a good sign) and got a few laughs at the desired points.<br /><br />Now I could brag here and now about how great I am and all that rubbish, but I still have room for improvement.  One of the things I found was that because I move through my slides pretty quickly I was rooted to the spot.  My left hand was always hovering near the cursor keys so I could advance to the next slide.  This meant that even though I was out in front of the audience I couldn't move around much.  I couldn't even talk with my hands!  It meant that I was able to convey quite as much emotion or passion as I <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">would've</span> liked.<br /><br />I think for next time I'll make sure I have one of those <a href="http://www.targus.com/AU/product_details.asp?sku=AMP02US">wireless <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">USB</span> presentation gizmo's</a>.  It'll mean I can move around somewhat and still control the slide progression.  It's a learning experience :-)
