<p>I've always thought that the "<a href="http://www.wickedlysmart.com/">Head First</a>" series of books were great.&nbsp; Head First Design Patterns in particular in an excellent book and really makes a lot of sense.</p> <p>Well I recently&nbsp;discovered that the authors have a blog called <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a>.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;all <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/about.html">about</a> making what you do more focused on the person using your products than on those making the products.&nbsp; In other words it's more about you than it is about me.</p> <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="113" src="http://headrush.typepad.com/images/AboutPage_r1_c3.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0"> </p> <p>Sure, the posts are on obvious subjects like thinking about your users, but if you're anything like me, the day-to-day of working in a company has a habit of getting in the way and you find&nbsp;your&nbsp;focus drifting to the internal company issues rather than staying on finding new and better ways to solve the issues that you're users/customers have.</p> <p>The good thing about the way these posts are written is that they're not condescending or insulting to your intelligence.</p> <p>If you've got any interest at all in the people who use your products then I'd strongly recommend having a look at this <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">blog</a>.</p>
