It's been 2 years since I started with my current employer and while being a CTO has been fun, I've been feeling recently that it's time for a change.  The higher I've been getting in management the less hands on I've been and recently I've not been able to spend much time at all on the Technology part of my role instead spending more and more in pure management.<br /><br />As a result, I've decided to leave my current employer and change tacks (slightly) on my career.  Today I 'm very happy to say that I've accepted an offer to join <a href="http://www.readify.com.au">Readify</a> as one of their senior consultants and will be starting with them shortly.<br /><br />For those who don't know <a href="http://www.readify.com.au/about+us.aspx">who Readify are</a>, they are a specialist consulting firm focused on technical readiness around Microsoft technologies.  In other words they help get companies and people prepared for the adoption of new technologies such as .NET 3.0, MOSS 2007 and so forth.<br /><br />Readify has a large number of <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/">MVP</a>'s on board, run a "virtual office" where people who aren't on client sites are working from home, and have a great and genuine belief in the need to keep developing their staff.  I know it sounds like an ad (sorry) but if you're interested have a look at the <a href="http://www.readify.com.au/Default.aspx?tabid=84">careers page</a> of their web site.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next step and seeing where things lead from here.  It should be fun.
