I've been talking recently with <a href="http://www.philipbeadle.net/Default.aspx">Philip Beadle</a> about the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471798436?tag=lorraine-20&camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0471798436&adid=0ZGQCEMCC06YZRCEVWNK&amp;">DotNetNuke for Dummies</a> that he co-authored and some of the effort involved in doing it.  I was then wandering through the local bookshop shortly afterwards and saw 4 copies of it on the shelves and thought to myself "That's pretty cool".<br /><br />But is it really worth it to write a book - and how much payback is there in doing it?  Here's a somewhat <a href="http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/146.aspx">sobering blog post</a> by <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/ScottMitchell.shtml">Scott Mitchell</a> about the realities of authoring a tech book.<br /><br />It's really worth reading; not as a deterrent but as a reality check.  If you want to write a tech book - go for it, just be prepared for it to be a labour of love, not a path to early retirement.
