OK, so it's no big surprise that there's a new version coming - as <a href="http://www.developmag.com/news/28300/Microsoft-reveals-XNA-Game-Studio-Express-20">announced at GameFest</a>.  The good news is that the XBox Live service will be available to all, and that it will work in any version of Visual Studio.<br /><br />This should make things a lot nicer to work with once it comes out.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they finally release, and it should help bring in more developers into the mix.  Maybe we'll even see XNA based apps turning up in the business world :-)  (It couldn't be any harder than WPF!)
