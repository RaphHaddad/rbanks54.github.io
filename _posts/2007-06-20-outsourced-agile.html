<p><a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/">Andrew</a> has <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2007/06/20/perils-of-agile-development-the-outsourcees-perspective/">posted</a> about a guy named Alex&nbsp;in Romania having a <a href="http://antiagile.indigenious.ro/" rel="nofollow">big rant</a> about using agile in an outsourcing arrangement.</p> <p>His argument is founded on everything that can go wrong with an agile project if you miss the fundamentals of agile and forget to "inspect &amp; adapt" your process to fit the situation.&nbsp; And while he doesn't outright say it, from what I can tell he's tried to use <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> (extreme programming) for his engagements.&nbsp; That in itself is a tough ask - XP is a very demanding methodology to follow (why&nbsp;do you think it's&nbsp;called <em>extreme</em>)&nbsp;and is really intended for internal short term projects, not outsourced arrangements where slightly more rigorous processes are more appropriate.</p> <p>And in case you're wondering I've run agile projects for large external customers before, so I know a thing or two.</p> <p>Let's take a look at some of his arguments:</p> <p><em><strong>1. The strong points of agile development don't turn out, in practice, to be that strong.&nbsp; Less paperwork isn't a good thing.</strong></em></p> <p>Who said an agile project shouldn't have documentation?&nbsp; Who said you can't document anything? And, um, are you nuts!! You can document requirements as you go - use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria, signed off UI mock ups, all sorts of things.&nbsp; Documentation in an agile project should be "just enough documentation" not "no documentation".</p> <p><em><strong>2. Stress and Unproductivity</strong></em></p> <p>Apparently it's stressful and unproductive to communicate with your customers and tell them what you're doing.&nbsp; I think someone needs to think seriously about what business they're in.&nbsp; Outsourced development is a service, and implies that customer communication is important.&nbsp; Agile methodologies stress the importance of communication.&nbsp; I don't see how this is a negative.&nbsp; If anything it's a positive as proper communication will result in improved outcomes for the client.</p> <p><em><strong>3. The First Meet-Up.&nbsp; (You can't estimating the size of the job)</strong></em></p> <p>Apparently in an agile project you're not allowed to estimate.&nbsp; What a crock!&nbsp; I'd like to point you to <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mike Cohn's</a> book on <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/book/1">Agile Estimating and Planning</a>.&nbsp; Agile says "don't lock down your estimates in stone", not "don't estimate".&nbsp; Every project needs estimates, plans and&nbsp;priorities.&nbsp; So make an estimate, and revisit that estimate as more information becomes available.</p> <p>And how does the ability to do an initial up front estimate get impacted by the methodology you use to deliver it?&nbsp; If a customer wants to know how long the piece of string is, it won't make any difference if you use waterfall or agile, it's still an estimate.&nbsp; Waterfall just deludes the customer into thinking that the estimate is accurate, all the way up to the missed delivery date!</p> <p><em><strong>4. What you deliver has changed from what was asked for and now they're upset</strong></em></p> <p>The project draws close to conclusion and the client&nbsp;<em>begins to&nbsp;realise</em> that the delivered solution will be different to what was asked for at the beginning and that this is a surprise to them, and they'll make you redo large parts of it.&nbsp; HELLO!!&nbsp; If there's been any communication going on then the variations that have been made will be based on what the customer asked for and put in a prioritised list.&nbsp; Oh, hang on, he didn't do any documentation and he doesn't like talking to the customer.&nbsp; Hmm, no wonder things went pear shaped.</p> <p>The statement that the "In the classic approach, it is impossible for both you and the client to be anything but happy" is just downright ludicrous!&nbsp; A delivered to spec project does not equal customer happiness.&nbsp; And while a spec may be "frozen" it's a guarantee that requirements will change.</p> <p><em><strong>5. Daily progress and showing the customer each day what has happened is bad.</strong></em></p> <p>I agree, so why do it?&nbsp; Why not show the customer at the end of an iteration.&nbsp; Every 2 - 4 weeks, and show how you've delivered on commitments (and possibly gotten ahead a little).&nbsp; The customer doesn't need (or want) to sit shoulder to shoulder with your team 8x5, but they do want to know what's going on.</p> <p><em><strong>6 Daily change requests. (when the client changes their mind every day).</strong></em></p> <p>Hmmm.&nbsp; And here I was thinking that in an agile project an iteration had a fixed scope, where commitments are made and delivered.&nbsp; I think someone missed the point about planing in an agile project.&nbsp; Change priorities, change scope, change as much as you like, but none of it takes effect until the next iteration.</p> <p>And the statement that "With the classic approach, change requests like this are impossible, since the specifications are frozen." goes against point 4 above - does anyone really think that a customer with a plethora of unactioned change requests will still be happy when you deliver to the original spec?</p> <p><em><strong>7. Clients know programming and will tell you how to do your job.</strong></em></p> <p>Is he serious?! You're responsible for your work, the customer is responsible for the specs.&nbsp; If you've got a customer who thinks they can manage your staff for you, then it won't matter how you run your project, it will fail.</p> <p><em><strong>8. Clients who want to run the show.</strong></em></p> <p>Why is a client getting involved in the programming?&nbsp; I just can't fathom it.&nbsp; The involvement of the customer in an agile project is for the clarification of requirements, business rules, etc.&nbsp; NOT for assistance with the code.&nbsp; Honestly, what is going on here?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All&nbsp;Alex's rant does is highlight the mistakes he's made.&nbsp; It's another great article on what NOT to do when adopting agile practices, especially in a client/vendor arrangement.</p>
