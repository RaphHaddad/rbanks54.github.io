Prior to each Microsoft MVP Summit, the Visual Studio ALM MVPs get together to share things they’ve learned or are doing that others might find useful or interesting, with each volunteer getting a 20 minute block.<br /><br />This year I did a session on using D3.js with the Visual Studio Online REST API showing how you could use it to generate charts. I meant to record a screen cast of the session but I forgot to hit record! My bad. Sorry about that.<br /><br />I’ll do a blog series on this to make it clearer, but until I get it all written up and ready to go, I’ll leave you with this webcam recording of the presentation. I hope you find it useful!<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" mozallowfullscreen="" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/111482031?byline=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe>
