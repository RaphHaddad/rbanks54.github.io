I'm trying to figure out what an ideal toolset is for my development team.  Currently the toolset consists of VS.NET 2003, SourceSafe, the <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/code_profiling.htm">Ants</a> code profiler and MS Virtual PC 2004.<br /><br />In the past I've used a whole suite of tools.  VS.NET 2003, <a href="http://www.nunit.org">NUnit</a>, <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a>, <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome%2Bto%2BCruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.NET</a>, VMWare, <a href="http://wincvs.org/">WinCVS</a> (and related tools), Compuware DevPartner Studio and more.<br /><br />With the application that's being developed I'm pretty sure that at least a good chunk of these tools will be needed, but I'd love to know if anyone has other suggestions that might be useful.  I'll follow with what I went with after I've settled in a bit more and run things through with the dev team.<br /><br />Also, if anyone has good recommendations for doing effective load testing on web applications I'd appreciate some feedback.
