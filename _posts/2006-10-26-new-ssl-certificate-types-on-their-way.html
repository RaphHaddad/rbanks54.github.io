As most of you would know SSL is a method for encrypting data in transmission between sites and SSL certificates are used to prove to people that your web site is who you say it is.  Unfortunately people assume that data transferred to/from an SSL site (you know - the ones using https) is not only secure, but that the site can also be trusted.<br /><br />This second assumption is incorrect, however new versions of SSL certificates are being readied that will change this.  Adding this verification will help bring an end to phishing, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />If you're interested have a read of <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/ScottHanselman/%7E3/41566656/HighAssuranceOrLdquoExtendedValidationrdquoEVSSLCertificates.aspx">this blog entry</a> for more information.
