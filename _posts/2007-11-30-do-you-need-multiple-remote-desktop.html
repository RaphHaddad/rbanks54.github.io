<p>OK, so this might not be applicable to everyone who reads this blog, but if youâ€™re one of those people (like me) who often opens multiple remote desktop connections and then ends up getting confused as to which is which then you might want to have a look at <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/terminals" target="_blank">Terminals</a> (from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com">Codeplex</a>)  <p><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/terminals" target="_blank">Terminals</a> gives you multiple tabbed remote desktops something like this:  <p><a href="http://lh5.google.com/rbanks54/R0-2vvezw-I/AAAAAAAAAKo/nisdw5455FI/terminals%5B4%5D"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="133" alt="terminals" src="http://lh4.google.com/rbanks54/R0-2wfezw_I/AAAAAAAAAKw/tyOW_ACvU0I/terminals_thumb%5B2%5D" width="644" border="0"></a>  <p>It's a piece of cake to install as well.&nbsp; Just unzip it somewhere and create a shortcut to the Terminals.exe program.</p> <p>Finally it's not just for remote desktop connections.&nbsp; As you can see in the title bar it also includes VNC, RAS, Telnet, SSH, Citrix support, and it also has a bunch of extra networking utilities accessible from the tools menu, like ping, traceroute and more.&nbsp; Definitely worth checking out.</p>
