<p><a href="http://www.ldarg.net/blog/" target="_blank">Daniel Crowley-Wilson</a> has just released a nifty little utility to copy the contents of a file to the clipboard without opening the file in notepad. Given it was done in an hour it's a very good piece of work.&nbsp; Check it out at <a title="http://www.ldarg.net/blog/2007/12/6/send-to-clipboard.html" href="http://www.ldarg.net/blog/2007/12/6/send-to-clipboard.html">http://www.ldarg.net/blog/2007/12/6/send-to-clipboard.html</a></p>
