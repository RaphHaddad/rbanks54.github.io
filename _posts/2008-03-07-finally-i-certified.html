<p>I'm pleased to say that I've just completed my Certified Scrum Master course.&nbsp; After 3 years of doing agile/scrum work I've finally decided to get some certifications.&nbsp; The course was presented by Jens Ostergaard and he did a great job teaching people about the principles and practices of Scrum.&nbsp; Also, rather graciously, he invited me to speak for 15 minutes and talk to the group about some of my experiences implementing Scrum in Australian companies.&nbsp; I take my hat off to him for giving me the opportunity, and a chance to cheekily plug my blog :-)</p> <p>For those who attended, I had a great time talking with you all, and here are some links you may find useful</p> <p><a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/" target="_blank">The Australian Scrum Community</a></p> <p>The <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/SyXPAC" target="_blank">SyXPAC</a> Mailing List &amp; <a href="http://syxpac.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Main Site</a> (Wiki)</p> <p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scrumdevelopment" target="_blank">Scrum Development Mailing List</a> (busy)</p> <p><a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/" target="_blank">Control Chaos</a> - Scrum Information by Ken Schwaber</p> <p>Mike Cohn - <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum" target="_blank">Mountain Goat Software</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.planningpoker.com/" target="_blank">Planning Poker</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.scrumprimer.com/" target="_blank">The Scrum Primer</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.agilealliance.org/" target="_blank">The Agile Alliance</a></p>
