As a followup on my previous post about <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2007/06/speed-up-your-browser.html">making your browser faster</a>, the vast majority of visitors to your web site will be using browsers loaded with the default settings.  How can they get a better experience when visiting your site?<br /><br />Thankfully <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a> & <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tenni08">Tenni Thourer</a> gave a <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/presentations/webex2007/souders_steve.ppt">presentation</a> on this subject a while back and now <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/">Rich Skrenta</a> has knocked up a <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/2007/05/14_rules_for_fast_web_pages_by_1.html">list of the key points with URLs</a> to the relevant resources and backup materials.  It's a really good reference list and I'm sure there's something in there for everyone to either learn for the first time or freshen up on.
