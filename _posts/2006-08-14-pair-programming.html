Finally!  I'm very happy to say that enough culture change has occurred in the department (and the recalcitrants are no longer a problem) that I can start moving the team into <a href="http://www.pairprogramming.com/">pair programming</a> and away from solo development.<br /><br />I kicked if off today with one team and their reception to it was very positive and the team worked well at it during the day.  Obviously we'll see what issues pop up during the next few weeks and then assess where we go from there, but the rest of the department are keen to see how it works out and so is the rest of the management team.<br /><br />Further updates in the coming weeks.
