Knowledge workers (ie programmers, designers, etc) need to keep mentally fresh and to ensure that they switch off from work when they leave the office. Failure to do so can lead to burn out, an imbalance between the personal life and the career, mentally exhaustion, poor health and more.<br /><br />I found an article on ZDNet along these lines.
