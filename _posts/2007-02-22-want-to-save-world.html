It looks like you can now help "save the world" by doing your bit to follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto protocol</a> (regardless of wether your country has signed up or not).  Each and every electrical devices consumes electricity and this contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.kyotopotato.com">Koyoto Potato</a> is a way of tracking your idle time, and trading it with other people so that you can do your bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (or to trade your excess idle time with others).<br /><br />I don't know if I'm explaining it too well, but have a look at the application and give it a go.  Every little bit counts.
