<p>One of the key aspects in any agile methodology is the &quot;inspect &amp; adapt&quot; process.&#xA0; Making sure that teams take the time to look at what is and isn't working for them and to then make the necessary changes to try and improve things.&#xA0; In <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com" target="_blank">Scrum</a> this is called the Sprint Retrospective and occurs at the end of every iteration (the Sprint).</p>  <p>The documentation on Scrum talks about sticking to 3 questions to keep the retrospective on track and to prevent it degenerating into yet another meeting; those questions being:</p>  <ul>   <li>What worked? </li>    <li>What didn't work? </li>    <li>What should we change? </li> </ul>  <p>However after a while it's very easy for these questions to become rote and for the retrospectives to stop being agents of change and improvement because the team has fallen into a rhythm and things just become the norm.</p>  <p>Diana Larsen and Esther Derby have written a very useful book (<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/dlret/" target="_blank">Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great</a>) about this subject and how you can keep retrospectives productive, valuable and pivotal in the success of your team.&#xA0; At the start of the year the good folks at Google had the two ladies come and have a chat with them about their experiences and have made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqtPZYigfNI" target="_blank">a video of their presentation available on YouTube</a>.&#xA0; It's not the most riveting presentation in the world, but they do bring a lot of useful tips and information to the table and hopefully you'll be able to get something useful out of it for both you and your team.</p>
