Yay!  <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> (the cool web development extension for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>) is now out of beta.<br /><br />If you haven't seen or used this thing, then it's time to crawl out from under your rock and check it out.  It's an invaluable tool for anyone doing any sort of web development.<br /><br />Get more info about it on the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/blog/2007/01/24/one-dot-oh/">Firebug blog entry</a>.<br /><br />P.S. <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/26/video-hewitt-firebug/">Yahoo has a video</a> of <a href="http://joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a> (Firebug's author) showing how it all works, including some of the advanced features.
