No longer a release candidate, <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">nHibernate 1.2</a> has now made it to production status, meaning it's fully supported and ready to roll.  Read about it <a href="http://blog.hibernate.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2007/05/03#nhibernate12-is-here">here</a> & <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/05/04/NHibernate-1.2-Released.aspx">here</a>.<br /><br />Given what's happening in nHibernate these days I can be pretty sure that the <a href="http://jcframework.sf.net">AtomsFramework </a>is now dead and buried.  It was fun to do, but nHibernate is really moving forward these days and with the future including LINQ integration there's no way a one-man part time effort can keep up.
