<p>For those who don’t know (or just plain forgot) I run a weekly podcast for developers at <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com">http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com</a> and in <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/2010/08/episode-24-developer-experience-index.html" target="_blank">one of the episodes</a> I talked with Matthew Wills about an idea I blogged about – the <a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/2010/08/developer-experience-index.html" target="_blank">Developer Experience Index</a> and wether we need one or not to improve the way we find and hire talent and raise the general skill level of the industry.</p>  <p>Interestingly I just ran across an opinion piece on GigaOm about the way hiring is changing and wether resumes are headed the way of the dodo - <a title="http://gigaom.com/collaboration/the-future-of-work-wont-contain-resumes/" href="http://gigaom.com/collaboration/the-future-of-work-wont-contain-resumes/">http://gigaom.com/collaboration/the-future-of-work-wont-contain-resumes/</a></p>  <p>It’s worth having a read, and most interestingly talks about the social networking aspects of hiring and how LinkedIn and your online presence in open source efforts can be a reflection of how well respected you are and wether you’re a good potential hire or not.</p>  <p>I still don’t think we’re there yet, but the aggregation of social networking information into a ranking of some kind is a very interesting approach to finding people, though likely will tend to favour those with the best connections or most popular projects, not necessarily the best developers for your team.&#160; Still, if nothing else, it reflects passion and involvement, and without passion for what they do a developer is pretty much worthless.</p>
