<p>About 18 months ago my Visual Studio 2012 Cookbook was published by Packt Press. Fast forward to a few weeks ago (March 25th in fact, I’m a little tardy on getting this post out) and an updated version of my book has been published, the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/visual-studio-2013-cookbook/book" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2013 Cookbook</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/visual-studio-2013-cookbook/book"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Ddw3lqbWsuY/U0Z5vr1ZauI/AAAAAAAABoo/-7qi1u6DfP0/image%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="199" height="244"></a></p> <p>I’ve been a little time poor over the last 12 months so I need to give a big shout out to <a href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Jeff-Martin" target="_blank">Jeff Martin</a> who made a large contribution to the book and without who it wouldn’t have happened. Thanks so much, Jeff!</p> <p>For those wondering what’s new, here’s some of the major changes in this version:</p> <ul> <li>Updates throughout the entire book to keep it in line with the various VS2013 changes (no surprises there!),</li> <li>A major update to the web development chapter based on the ASP.NET changes, editor improvements and new tooling such as Browser Link,</li> <li>A major update to the Team Foundation Server chapter, with particular focus on the new Team Explorer and git source control integration, and</li> <li>A new chapter on using TypeScript and Python with Visual Studio.</li></ul> <p>As with the previous edition, this book isn’t for everyone. It’s for those people wanting to get up to speed with the changes and improvements in VS2013 and is going to be more suited to those coming to VS2013 from older editions of Visual Studio, or those who are used to Eclipse or XCode and are wanting to know how to get to grips with an unfamiliar, and very powerful, IDE.</p> <p>Go <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/visual-studio-2013-cookbook/book" target="_blank">buy yourself a copy from Packt</a> or your favourite book selling web site today!</p>
