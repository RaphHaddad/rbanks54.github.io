<p>The inaugural <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/" target="_blank">Scrum Australia conference</a> is on in Sydney this April and I’ll be there, speaking about the mistakes Product Owners tend to make.&#160; if that doesn’t interest you then fear not, as there’s plenty of other great content being delivered. Don’t believe me? Just have a <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/programme/programme-schedule/" target="_blank">look at the schedule</a>. There’s even an open space event for making sure you get to talk with other people about topics that specifically interest you.</p>  <p>This should be a great conference so talk to work and arrange some time out so you can get along on April 11 and 12. I’ll see you there!</p>
