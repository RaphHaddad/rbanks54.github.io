<p>Back at the start of 2009 I picked up an Alienware desktop (<a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/2009/02/my-new-desktop.html">post and pictures here</a>) and at the time it was perfect for my needs, and how I did love it so, but as theses stories go time passed and I found myself neglecting my desktop and spending more and more time with my other love – my laptop.&#160; It’s what I use for my day to day work needs and as fate would have it where I ended up running almost everything that I once used my desktop for including my PC gaming since it has a decent enough graphics card and I get to take it with me when I travel.&#160; The desktop has slowly been turning into nothing more than the place where I host my iTunes music collection.&#160; Sad, I know.</p>  <p>Now recently this machine has been randomly shutting down. Initially I thought it was related to a video card driver update that had just came through shortly after Win 7 SP1, but it was a little too random and a driver rollback didn’t fix anything so I cracked open the case to check the internals, and what do I find? That the heat sink and cooling fan are loose in their mountings!&#160; The plastic bracket used to hold the heat sink and CPU together had cracked and broken meaning that the CPU had only minimal contact with the heat sink.&#160; This would explain the random shutdowns.</p>  <p>So now I have a decision.&#160; Do I replace a few parts and get it running again or bid farewell to the desktop, and treat the laptop as the genuine desktop replacement it is?&#160; I’ve decided it’s time to say R.I.P. dear desktop and time to spend all my time with just the laptop.&#160; I’ll get an external HDD enclosure so I can still get my music and other files off the desktop drive, but that will be all.</p>  <p>So a question for you.&#160; Would you do the same if it was you, have you long said goodbye to your desktop and think I’ve been a luddite for hanging on to mine for so long, or would keep the big box and use simply upgrade the motherboard and CPU, etc?&#160; I’m curious.</p>  <p>P.S. If anyone wants to make an offer on a second hand Alienware desktop, needing a new CPU &amp; motherboard with 4GB RAM and a decent graphics card, then let me know either via email or twitter.</p>
