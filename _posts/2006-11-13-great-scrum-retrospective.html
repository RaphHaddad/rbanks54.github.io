<p>There' s a rather long but very interesting <a title="Scrum and XP from the Trenches" href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/ScrumAndXpFromTheTrenches.pdf">paper</a> by Henrik Kniberg about his experiences establishing scrum with multiple teams over the last 12 months.</p> <p>Lot's of really practical stuff in there including the things that didn't work so well.&nbsp; The information about testers and how they fit in the scrum process was excellent, and I see a lot of similarity in how he's structured his teams and been pragmatic in his approach and in what I've done.</p> <p>If you're just getting started with Scrum or want some tips of fine tuning your problem areas go have a look!</p>
