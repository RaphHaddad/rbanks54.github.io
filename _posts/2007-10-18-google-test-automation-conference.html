<p>Yes, it's a few months old now, but for those people who are interested in test automation (and who isn't!) Google ran a test automation conference called, amazingly enough, GTAC 2007, and have graciously uploaded a whole bunch of videos from the conference onto youtube.</p> <p>If you want to get a little more info on test automation, or a different point of view, check out the videos at: <a title="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22gtac+2007%22" href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22gtac+2007%22">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22gtac+2007%22</a></p> <p>Enjoy!</p>
