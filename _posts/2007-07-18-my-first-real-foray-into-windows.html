<p>I've read a bit about Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) in the past, but I've never done real-world with it.&nbsp; Recently I've been doing a bit of work helping a client get a proof of concept solution up and running for an SOA based forms workflow environment.</p> <p>I've been using state based workflows, getting my head around the event handling model, the way the workflow interacts with the host (especially interesting when the host is ASP.NET web services&nbsp; - and no, I'm not talking about workflows exposed as web services), developing custom activities for AD interactions and sending emails (via other web services)&nbsp;and all kinds of other interesting things like error handling and so forth.</p> <p>I must say, my heads still spinning with all the new information I've been cramming into it.&nbsp; WF is just so big &amp; deep &amp; flexible. I always thought it was a bit lightweight and only designed to help people with UI wizard-style forms, but it's oh so much more than that.&nbsp; There's a whole world of possibilities that have opened up before my eyes :-)&nbsp; I think I'll be getting into this a bit more over the coming months as it's very, very interesting stuff.</p>
