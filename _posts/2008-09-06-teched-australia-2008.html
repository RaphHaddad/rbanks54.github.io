<p>Tech.Ed Australia is over for another year and for me this Tech.Ed was very different to the others I have been to.&nbsp; Previously I have attended as a delegate an I've simply gone to sessions and absorbed as much information and opinions from the presenters as I could.</p> <p>This year I was fortunate enough to be given a breakout session on the Architecture track in which I talked about Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control and Unity (the IoC container that is part of enterprise library 4).&nbsp; I also had a "chalk and talk" session where I gave a 20 minute version of my agile agile presentation.</p> <p>Both sessions were well attended and for everyone who came and especially to those who gave me constructive feedback, I'd like to pass on a big thank you.</p> <p>Apart from my sessions I also spent time getting the TFS environment and automated build and deployment scripts set up for the Tech.Ed DevGarten project where we were redeveloping the UNICEF web site, and I spent a fair bit of one-on-one time with some of the conference delegates who wanted to talk about either unity or agile development.</p> <p>As for the other breakout sessions I only made it to a handful - I went to Scott Hanselman's presentation on ASP.NET MVC so I could pick up some tips on presentation style, a session on dynamic languages (Iron Python, Iron Ruby, etc) and one on F# so I could get expand my thinking beyond C# and VB.NET, and also one on managing complex development as I've worked with one of the presenters and was curious to see what would be said.</p> <p>All up I thought it was a great tech.ed and I'd like to thank Microsoft and the DPE/Marketing teams for organising such a great event. Well done to all!</p>
