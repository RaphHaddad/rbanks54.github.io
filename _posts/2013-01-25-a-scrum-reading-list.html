<p>When I run one of my Scrum.org classes I’ll often mention various books that I’ve found useful and students will typically jot down those book names for looking up later. When one of the students in a class I did recently asked for links to all the books I mentioned I thought to myself “Why didn’t I have that list handy?” So, after that #facepalm feeling passed I organised myself and put together an Amazon ListMania list for future reference. Here it is for your perusal.</p>  <p>Richard’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Reading-List/lm/R1SSXMY0DAE472/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full" target="_blank">Scrum Reading List</a></p>  <p>Enjoy!</p>
