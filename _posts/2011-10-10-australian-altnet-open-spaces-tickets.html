<p>The inaugural <a href="http://ozaltnetopenspaces.squarespace.com/">Australian Alt.NET Opens Spaces unconference</a> is happening on Sat Dec 3 in Melbourne, directly after the Melbourne YOW! event.</p>  <p>(Free!) <a href="http://ozaltnetopenspaces.eventbrite.com/">Tickets are now available</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>And for the curious amongst you, the famous <a href="http://altnetseattle.pbworks.com/w/page/12367896/AltNet-Seattle-2011">Seattle Alt.Net conference</a> is run in exactly this style, and has the motto of “practice don’t preach” to indicate that it’s all about participation.&#160; Have a search for people’s thoughts on the conference and you’ll invariably find people who found the conference much more enjoyable that traditional lecture style conferences.</p>  <p>So what are you waiting for? Go and <a href="http://ozaltnetopenspaces.eventbrite.com/">book a ticket</a>! I’ve got mine, you should get your hands on one too.</p>  <p>And don’t forget to spread the word!&#160; The more we have there, the better! Rewteet this post, write your own tweets, put a post on Facebook or LinkedIn, blog about it, tell your colleagues; whatever works.</p>
