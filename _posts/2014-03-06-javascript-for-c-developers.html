At the back end of last year I put together a training course for a few hundred developers that were stepping into the brave new world of AngularJS development and REST APIs. As part of that course there is a section on JavaScript for the C# developer and what they need to get their head around when with working with JS.<br /><br />To help deliver the content to all these people one of my colleagues, the irrepressible <a href="http://blog.tatham.oddie.com.au/" target="_blank">Tatham Oddie</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/tathamoddie" target="_blank">@tathamoddie</a>), helped with the delivery and fine-tuning of the course. He also recently presented the JavaScript for C# devs section at a FireBootCamp session which has been recorded for your benefit.<br /><br />You can find <a href="http://blog.tatham.oddie.com.au/2014/03/04/presentation-javascript-for-c-devs/" target="_blank">his post about it</a> on his blog, and I've embedded the video here for your benefit.
