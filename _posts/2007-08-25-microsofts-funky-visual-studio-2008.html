I don't quite know what to make of this one. Check out <a href="http://www.defyallchallenges.com/">http://www.defyallchallenges.com/</a> see what you think and then let me know, because I'm can't quite get a grip on it.  First, what's the point of it, but secondly, if VS2008 is so great then why is site built using flash and not silverlight or AJAX??<br /><br />Regardless, it's got some cool sound effects and great animations.  I've been playing with it just to see things move :-)
