OK, so maybe <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> did think the whole lawsuit thing through when they bought <a href="http://www.youtube.com"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">YouTube</span></a>.  According to the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">SMH</span></a> web site they've <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/google-hedges-against-youtube-lawsuits/2006/11/16/1163266647261.html">set aside $200M</a> for settling lawsuits.<br /><br />That's some serious cash!  And as a honeypot I'm sure it'll attract the lawyers in swarms.  I suppose the thinking is that you get all the lawsuits out of the way now, tighten up the copyright controls on <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">YouTube</span> and then get on with life.<br /><br />I still can't figure out where the return for them is, though the article talks about <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">YouTube</span> having a commercial component to it.  Maybe <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">that'll</span> work...
