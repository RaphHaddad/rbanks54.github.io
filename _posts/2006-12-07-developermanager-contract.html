<p>Okay, so it might be a bit of a fluff post, but <a title="Software By Rob" href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/default.aspx">Rob</a> has a "good faith" <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/archive/2006/12/06/Open_Letter_to_Software_Managers_of_the_World_.aspx">contract</a> between the software developers of this world and the poor sods who get to manage them - like myself for instance :-)</p><p>Having been on both sides of the fence, I can agree with pretty much all of the points.  I'm not sure about "building the best solution possible" as there are always constraints, and what a dev thinks is the best thing possible solution might not be what the customer wants.  Overall though, the points are valid and worth looking over if you want to assess where you are at either as a developer, manager or one of the people with a foot in both camps (a technical team lead for instance).</p>
