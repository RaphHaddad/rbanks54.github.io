OK, so it's probably not the size of the YouTube purchase, but <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> has <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/01/08/yahoo-buys-mybloglog-for-real/">shelled out</a> for <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/">MyBlogLog</a>.  I <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/11/sitemeter-and-mybloglog-comparison-part.html">posted</a> <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/11/mybloglog.html">previously</a> about MyBlogLog as a stats and link tracking system, however one aspect I didn't really dwell on is the social side of it - something which most stats systems don't have.<br /><br />It appears that this social aspect is the main reason Yahoo purchased them - they want to get a bigger slice of the social pie and this is a different angle on it.  I expect that MyBlogLog will change a bit to incorporate other Yahoo social networking tools and that we'll see Yahoo ad's appearing somewhere soon as well.  It'll be interesting to see how it pans out.<br /><br />Congratulations to the MyBlogLog team.<br /><br />Update: There's an <a href="http://mybloglogb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/01/the_jig_is_up_m.html">official blog entry</a> about the purchase and what is going to happen.  Looks like a lot of improvements will be coming soon.
