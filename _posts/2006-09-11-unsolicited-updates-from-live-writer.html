Very impressive!  I posted recently about how you can't use <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">live writer</a> with the <a href="http://beta.blogger.com/">blogger beta</a>.  Well I got a comment from <a href="http://dragonstyle.typepad.com/">one of the team</a> indicating it won't be long till they get it all sorted out.<br /><br />I'm surprised and impressed because it means people in the live writer team not only have time to read up on what others are saying about their product but also care enough to update people.  I can only say really well done!  They're setting a great example on how to support and help people in the community without requiring a support contract, inanely telling people to read the FAQ or trying to extract personal information so that they can on-sell it to mass-marketers.  If only some of the other players in the industry would take notice!
