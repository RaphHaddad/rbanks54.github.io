<p>With Windows 8 being RTM’ed and a slew of new devices to be launched on October 26 (just a few weeks away) I can’t help but wonder where the new keyboards are.&#160; Sure, Microsoft has <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/46700/windows-eight-bluetooth-keyboards-mice-announced" target="_blank">announced some new keyboards and mice</a>, but they’re not gesture enables and have no charm keys on them.&#160; The keyboard is just a fairly standard keyboard with the new Windows logo on it.&#160; Boring!</p>  <p><img alt="Windows 8 Bluetooth keyboards and mice announced" src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/GXYy/windows-eight-bluetooth-keyboards-mice-announced-0.jpg?20120820-143904" /></p>  <p>I was expecting something to be announced that supports the touch style gestures and the Windows 8 Charms. The <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboards/wireless-touch-keyboard-k400" target="_blank">Logitech K400</a> is has potential with it’s inbuilt touchpad but is still missing the key elements.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-JKuU70mn7_s/UGOVCq0oNGI/AAAAAAAABV8/hrHD9fdeb80/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-HNP4q_9xXDQ/UGOVEh6SYtI/AAAAAAAABWE/iygGxbXSDVk/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="534" height="214" /></a></p>  <p>So, what do I want on my keyboard?</p>  <p>Firstly, I want the charms on my keyboard, mirroring what’s on screen.&#160; Sure, I can press Win+C just like everyone else, but I’d rather a single key press. I’m lazy.</p>  <p>I also want a mini-display on my keyboard that mirrors my current display so I can do swipes, pinch and zoom, and so on simply by using gestures on the in-keyboard display instead of reaching out across my desk to touch the screen and looking like a fool. Plus too much of that and I’d get a tired arm.</p>  <p>I want something a little like this and I’m willing to pay for it:    <br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-DD-7Hnet5zk/UGOVGTZK9AI/AAAAAAAABWM/Z4y3I8ZPHzA/s1600-h/SNAGHTML2ce30ce%25255B5%25255D.png"><img title="SNAGHTML2ce30ce" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML2ce30ce" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1DjCIQHtHN0/UGOVH473NOI/AAAAAAAABWU/3zmM7haW1RU/SNAGHTML2ce30ce_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="561" height="208" /></a></p>  <p>Maybe something has already been announced, but if so I can’t find it.</p>  <h3>UPDATE</h3>  <p>I just came across the <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-deathstalker-ultimate" target="_blank">DeathStalker keyboard from Razer</a>.&#160; This looks really promising. Here’s the main thing that could make it work – the <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/switchblade-ui" target="_blank">Switchblade UI</a>.&#160; I could definitely see the charm keys up along the top of the trackpad and the trackpad itself looks like it has the display and multitouch capabilities sorted already.&#160; Looks like all we need is a Windows 8 app written for it.&#160; Does anyone have some rock hard C++ skills? :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-1qTjDoVu7EE/UGVnEhZoeBI/AAAAAAAABWs/s-XKyuTevWQ/s1600-h/image%25255B5%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-0_HhNV0MsXA/UGVnGk8Fb7I/AAAAAAAABW0/E0-PqXgvFL8/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="326" /></a></p>
