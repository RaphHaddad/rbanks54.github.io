<p>James &amp; Martin are running <a href="http://www.scrummaster.com.au/Article.mvc/Detail/41">a survey</a> trying to get a feel for how Scrum is being dong within Australia.</p> <p>The more responses the better, so <a href="http://www.scrummaster.com.au/Article.mvc/Detail/41">head on over</a> and give it a run through.&nbsp; Itâ€™ll take you all of 5 minutes, if that.</p>
