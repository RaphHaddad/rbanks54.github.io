I first picked this one up on via <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/author/Andrew+Hallam/">Andrew</a> on the <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/2007/07/12/managing-software-development">Australian Scrum Community</a>.  Reg Braithwaite has written <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/06/which-theory-first-evidence.html">an essay</a> on the difference between Deterministic development and Probabilistic development.<br /><br />It's a great read, and if I ever needed another reminder why "inspect &amp; adapt" is a great mantra to follow and of the difficulties in implementing organisational change in an embedded Deterministic culture then this is it.
