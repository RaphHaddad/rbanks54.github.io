New Years celebrations this year were a little different.  Being on the Gold Coast instead of in Sydney for New Years means that the usual extravagant fireworks display Sydney usually puts on was traded in for a local fireworks show at Paradise Point.<br /><br />It was a lovely night, sitting by the water with the family, and when the show finally got started at 9pm it went for about 15 mintues and was a lot better than expected.<br /><br />Here's a few photos - I didn't have a tripod handy so some of the photo's are a little wobbly but worked out reasonably well in any case.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/341789878/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/124/341789878_02ec560346_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="IMG_3889" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/341789753/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/341789753_3ffd2c9b80_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_3893" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/341789573/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/341789573_c64ee55a4d_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="IMG_3913" /></a>
