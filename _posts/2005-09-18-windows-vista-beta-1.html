The latest MSDN shipment finally arrived an in it was a shiny new copy of the Longhorn Beta 1 release (aka <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.mspx">Windows Vista</a>).  I'd thought about downloading it before, but any MSDN download over 1 Gb I usually wait for.<br /><br />My impressions first up were from a user perspective (ignoring all the funky stuff under the hood) and it seems like quite a good update to the O/S.  Obviously there are other sites that explain it all in more detail and I'd recommend you go have a look at <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/vista/">Paul Thurott's site</a> for example.<br />My biggest problem I had was that IE7 didn't work with my asp.net application.  It seems to be something to do with the viewstate or something - I'll have to investigate.<br /><br />Oh - one big tip - don't install it in VirtualPC 2004 unless you have to. It's dead slow and painful to use.  If you've got the disk space make and use a spare partition (eg using Partition Magic) and install to that.  The performance difference is massive especially if you don't have truck loads of RAM.
