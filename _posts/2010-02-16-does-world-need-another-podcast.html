<p>Or do you for that matter?</p>  <p>For those who don’t <a href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54">follow me on twitter</a> (and why not!?) I’ve been doing an internal podcast in Readify where I interview some of our new staff.&#160; Anyway <a href="http://twitter.com/davetchepak">Dave</a> (who is not Readify) suggested that I create a public podcast as well, which I have thought about before.</p>  <p>Before I do, here’s a few questions I’d like to hear some opinions on:</p>  <p>1. Would you actually listen to one? (Assuming the quality didn’t completely suck)</p>  <p>2. What’s your ideal podcast length? (I’ve been doing 15-25 minutes internally)</p>  <p>3. If I do an interview style podcast (think hanselminutes) then who should I try to get on as guests?</p>  <p>All feedback and ideas are welcome :-) and any disparaging remarks can be forwarded to my support email at&#160; <a href="mailto:talktothehand@carefactor.com">talktothehand@carefactor.com</a></p>  <p>P.S. I asked this same set of questions on the <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/ozaltdotnet">OzAlt.Net mailing list</a>, so you can always reply there if you prefer.</p>
