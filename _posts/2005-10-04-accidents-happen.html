It was a public holiday in Australia yesterday, so my wife & I took the girls to Carrs Park for a play in the park and a swim at the beach.<br /><br />Everything was going great until our youngest daughter (2 years old) managed to step on a sharp rock or clam shell and slice her foot open. Needless to say that there is a sense of panic when your 2 year old walks out of the water crying and leaving little bloody footprints in the sand. Luckily we have a basic first aid kit in the car and could tightly bandage up her foot to minimise the bleeding, and get her to a medical centre where she could get 4 stitches in two separate gashes.<br /><br />Holding down your youngest while she gets stitches put in, and with her crying and screaming through the ordeal is quite difficult emotionally. Watching the stitches get put in was really interesting (I've had stitches myself on 5 separate occasions for various injuries and never actually watched them being put in) but the holding down part wrenches your heart.<br /><br />The good news is that today she seems to be much more herself and is quite mobile, even if she is getting around only on her knees.<br /><br />For a little bit of fun, I thought I'd play with Google Earth to see if I could get the links as url's in the post. Whilst there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do it with Google Earth, you can do it with Google Maps. There is even a <a href="http://perljam.net/cgi-bin/hhmmss-to-google-maps.cgi">web page</a> with a URL generator.<br /><br />Carrs Park can be seen <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.990469,151.119364&amp;spn=0,0&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">here</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:78%;">Please note that you can create KMZ files that open as links in Google Earth but I can't host these on blogger so I can't add the links as a URL.</span>
