With the release of <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/">Visual Studio 2005</a> Microsoft have been publishing new documents and guides faster than the eye can blink.  The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/VS2005/">Patterns &amp; Practices</a> team have been putting out a good chunk of these, and they've also just released a new CTP version of the Enterprise Library (or EntLib).<br /><br />It's a real shame that their stuff is hosted on GotDotNet - it's one of the worst sites in terms of performance I've ever seen.
