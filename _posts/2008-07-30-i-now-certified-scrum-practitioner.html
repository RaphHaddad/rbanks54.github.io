<p>I finally got my notification through that I am now a Certified Scrum Practitioner.&nbsp; It's means that the scrum alliance certifies that I've been working with Scrum for over a year now and that I know what I'm doing.</p> <p>For regular readers of this blog I'd hope that it was self apparent :-) but it's nice to have an external body say it as well.&nbsp; In time I'm aiming to get the Certified Scrum Coach and/or Certified Scrum Trainer certifications, but that's going to take quite some time given the pre-requisites.</p>
