So, after some time of thinking about it, I've decided to start a blog.<br /><br />What will I talk about here?  Who knows - only time will tell.<br /><br />At this point in time, I'm about to wrap up my current employment (3 days to go) and move to a new company as a .NET Technical Architect.  Should be very interesting, and I'll post updates here to see how things pan out.<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see how things progess in a new environment, and how different various software companies are.  After all, I've been at this one company now for over 9 years.  That's a long time to stay in one place in the software industry!<br /><br />Anyway,  I'll try to keep things moving in terms of the blog, and try to post new stuff fairly regularly.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what the future will hold :-)
