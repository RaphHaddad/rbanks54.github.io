This is completely unrelated to anything technical, but I just noticed that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000128/">Russell Crowe</a> (yes the actor from Gladiator) is now <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/shopping-centre-superstar/2006/04/22/1145344321411.html">singing in suburban shopping centres</a>.  The one he graced is only about 15 minutes from where I live.<br /><br />I just find it funny/strange that someone who is such a great actor (let's forget his offscreen performances) can be sooo fixated on something he's not all that great at.  Then again... if we had his sort of income and spare time we'd probably end up wasting it on something we had no hope of being great at, like motor racing, basketball, first-person shooters, etc :-)
