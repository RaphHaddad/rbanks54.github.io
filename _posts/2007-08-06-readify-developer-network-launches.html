'tis the season to be launching<br />fa la la la, fa la la la.<br /><br />Not only has <a href="http://www.readify.net/">Readify</a> launched <a href="http://www.tfsnow.com/">TFSNow</a>, but we're also launching the <a href="http://readify.net/rdn">Readify Developer Network</a> - a free and open session for anyone to come along to and hopefully learn something of interest to them.   Webcast versions will also be made available as a resource for the community.<br /><br />Greg Low has <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/greglow/archive/2007/08/06/announcing-the-readify-developer-network.aspx">all the details</a> on his blog and Darren Neimke has more info on <a href="http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=93be9c21-eabd-4ef5-a39a-ae616d83ae23">some of the people involved</a> (including yours truly).<br /><br />Personally, I'll be involved in the Agile presentations but there's so much more on offer that there should be something for everyone - so go have a look at <a href="http://www.readify.net/rdncalendar.aspx">the timetable</a>, think about registering for a session or two and put the dates in your diary.<br /><br />I hope to see you there!
