I finally got around to setting up a <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> account for keeping track of my bookmarks - they're shown on the left.<br /><br />Also, now that the blog is getting a little larger, I've added <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> site search to make finding older posts a bit easier.<br /><br />If there's something else you think I should add, let me know.
