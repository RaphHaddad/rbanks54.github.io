Well, the Vista release has been thoroughly uneventful, so the "Wow!" certainly didn't start there.  On the other hand the <a href="http://www.thewpfblog.com/">WPF blog</a> has a post about something that <a href="http://thewpfblog.com/?p=88">really makes me say "Wow!"</a> and it's even Vista related.<br /><br />There's an awesome <a href="http://www.vista.si/">WPF/E  Vista mockup</a> on the web, complete with Office 2007 applications and other cool stuff.  Check out the screenshot below.  I've tried it on both IE 7 on the PC and Firefox on the Mac and both work really well.   I'm very impressed!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://thewpfblog.com/images/wpfevista.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://thewpfblog.com/images/wpfevista.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
