Well, it's broken again - very frustrating.<br /><br />The <a href="http://beta.blogger.com">blogger beta</a> seems to have changed something that stops <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">windows live writer</a> from connecting to the site.  I've tried posting, listing and even re-adding the blog but I just keep getting an error telling me I can't connect to the remote site.<br /><br />I guess it's wait a little bit and see if the guys on the live writer team can't get a fix out soon-ish.  Until then, it's back to cut &amp; paste of the HTML into the blogger editor.
