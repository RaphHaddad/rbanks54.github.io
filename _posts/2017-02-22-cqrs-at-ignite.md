Last week I was at [Microsoft's Ignite Australia](https://msftignite.com.au/) conference where I presented three different talks.

This talk is on the CQRS design pattern and delves into what the pattern is all about, how it can help you with scale and performance, and why concerns such as eventual consistency and event sourcing are separate from, but associated with the pattern.

For fun, I also threw in a little bit of Application Insights to show how you can trace CQRS calls through a system and monitor what's happening in production.

Slides are availabe from [https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/ARC323](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/ARC323)
