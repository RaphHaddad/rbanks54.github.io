I've just received a new laptop and a new mobile phone as part of my employment with <a href="http://www.readify.net">Readify</a>, so I'm now the owner of a Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop (T7700 CPU &amp; 4GB RAM) and a <a href="http://www.htctouch.com/">HTC Touch</a> windows mobile device.<br /><br />I've now got to go through the pain of (re)installing everything I use yet again.  And then of getting used to a new wider keyboard and slightly different layout for the hom/end keys, etc.<br /><br />I must say though, in the limited time I've played with it the HTC Touch seems to be quite a nice phone.  It's about the same size as the Motorola V3 I've been using for the last few years and not much heavier.  Plus it's got those funky finger swipes you can use to control the interface.  Way cool :-)<br /><br />Right then.  I'm off to go install stuff (and play with gadgets).  I'll post again when I surface for air!
