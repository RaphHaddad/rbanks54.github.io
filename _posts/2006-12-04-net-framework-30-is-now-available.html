<p>So the new version of the <a title=".NET 3.0 Overview" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663309.aspx">.NET Framework</a> is <a title=".NET 3.0 Download" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=10CC340B-F857-4A14-83F5-25634C3BF043&amp;displaylang=en">now available</a>.&nbsp; For some reason it's called version 3.0 even though it's really just Version 2.0 with fries.&nbsp; I guess it must be something to do with Microsoft's reputation of needing to get to Version 3.0 of a technology before it's seen as mature.</p> <p>P.S. The extra's are <a title="WPF Overview" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx">Windows Presentation Foundation</a>, <a title="Cardspace Overview" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663320.aspx">Cardspaces</a> (InfoCard), <a title="WCF Overview" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">Windows Communication Foundation</a> and <a title="WF Overview" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663328.aspx">Windows Workflow Foundation</a>.&nbsp; All of which have some interest for me (especially the workflow stuff).</p> <p>All the extra technologies are cool - particularly the workflow stuff.&nbsp; I can see the potential use for each and every one of these extra technologies in what I do at work and it's great to see Microsoft are making them part of the standard .NET framework.</p> <p>Looks like it's time do some reading...</p>
