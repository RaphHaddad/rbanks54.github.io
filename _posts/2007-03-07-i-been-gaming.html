<p><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds" atomicselection="true"><img src="http://www.cnet.co.uk/i/c/nws/nintendo_ds_lite.jpg" align="left" /></a>Over the last few weeks I haven't exactly done a lot of posting.  My apologies for that.</p> <p>There's been a few reasons:</p> <p>1. I've been absolutely rushed off my feet at work recently and finish each day mentally drained and not feeling all that bloggish.</p> <p>2. (This could be the main reason) I bought a <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds">Nintendo DS Lite</a> and got <a href="http://metroidhunters.com/">Metroid Prime Hunters</a> and <a href="http://www.hoteldusk.com/">Hotel Dusk</a>.  Playing with my new toy seems to take up a lot of time...</p> <p>Damn this portable gaming stuff :-) </p> <p>Metroid is lots of fun, and once you get the hang of using the stylus to mouse-look it's really cool and intuitive.</p> <p>Hotel Dusk is obviously a little slower, being a detective game, but it's good fun and slowly drags you in - a bit like quicksand - until you can't leave it alone.</p> <p>I'll remember to post a little more often even if I have to ignore the siren call of handheld gaming!!</p> <p><a href="http://metroidhunters.com/" atomicselection="true"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Mph_cover_updated.jpg/250px-Mph_cover_updated.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://www.hoteldusk.com/" atomicselection="true"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Hotel_Dusk.jpg" /></a></p>
