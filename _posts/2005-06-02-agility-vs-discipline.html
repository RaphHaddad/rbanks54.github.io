Over the last 14 years, I've done plenty of software development.  I've worked on projects that have been run in a very structured manner and others that have been run in a more "flexible" manner, as well as open source projects.<br /><br />I've always found it very interesting to see how different projects are run, both as a team member (ie a grunt) and also as a manager.<br /><br />So I found it very interesting when I came across the book "Balancing Agility & Discipline: A Guide For The Perplexed" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321186125/ref=pd_ys_pym_a_4/103-7263317-1481438?v=glance">Amazon link</a>).   I've recently been focussing on adopting some of the agile methods into my development teams, but some of the methods don't really sit well with me.  This book takes a very pragmatic approach to combining the best of both worlds to fit your particular needs and gives some foundation to backup my thinking.<br /><br />If you're interested in incorporating some or all of the agile methods into your project teams, but aren't too sure about how they would fit to your organisation, I'd recommend grabbing a copy.  Alternatively, if your so agile that you don't know where you're meant to be pointing, then this may help you to put a rudder on your project and get some direction again.<br /><br />Well worth a read.
