<p>I performed an upgrade on my Vista SP1 based laptop today to the Win 7 Release Candidate and after the upgrade everything looked OK, except for the All Programs folder under the Start Menu being blank, empty, vacant, non-existent.</p> <p>What was strange though is that I could search for programs via the Start Menu and it would still find them and I could run them.&nbsp; A quick bit of hunting around on Google led me to <a href="http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/2009/05/story-of-windows-7-and-empty-all.html" target="_blank">Greg Duncan’s post</a> where he explained the problem and a workaround.</p> <p>So, if you’re having the same problem, <a href="http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/2009/05/story-of-windows-7-and-empty-all.html" target="_blank">head over there</a> and try it out.&nbsp; The workaround/fix resolved the issue for me.&nbsp; Hopefully it’ll do the same for you.</p>
