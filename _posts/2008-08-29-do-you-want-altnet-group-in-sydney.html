<p>I'm gauging interest on starting an <a href="http://altdotnet.org/" target="_blank">ALT.NET</a> group in Sydney.&nbsp; I've <a href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54/statuses/902706586" target="_blank">tweeted about it</a>, and <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet/message/14200" target="_blank">posted</a> on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet/" target="_blank">altdotnet mailing list</a> to see who might be a part of it and so far things are looking good.&nbsp; I figure I might as well blog about it as well :-D</p> <p>Now in case you don't know what I'm talking about, <a href="http://www.altnetpedia.com/OverviewWhatIsIt.ashx" target="_blank">here's a definition of ALT.NET</a>:</p> <ul> <li>You’re the type of developer who uses what works while keeping an eye out for a better way.</li> <li>You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community: Open Source, Agile, Java, Ruby, etc. </li> <li>You’re not content with the status quo. Things can always be better expressed, more elegant and simple, more mutable, higher quality, etc. </li> <li>You know tools are great, but they only take you so far. It’s the principles and knowledge that really matter. The best tools are those that embed the knowledge and encourage the principles</li></ul> <p>If you'd like to be a part of something like this, then leave a comment so I know who to get in touch with.</p> <p>If there's enough interest to make it worth kicking off it'll then just be a matter of sorting out the logistics (i.e. finding a location, date &amp; time, etc) and getting the message out.</p>
