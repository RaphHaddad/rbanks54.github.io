Towards the start of the year <a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/2015/01/the-anz-coders-virtual-conference.html">I blogged</a> about the <a href="http://www.anzcoders.com/">ANZ Coders</a> virtual conference that I decided to organise.<br /><br />Well, the date of the conference fast approaches. I've just closed off session submissions and have opened up the conference for registrations and voting on the sessions.<br /><br />So, why not <a href="http://www.anzcoders.com/">head over to the conference site and register</a>. Once that's done, have a look at the sessions and vote for the ones you think will be most interesting!<br /><br />After all that's done? Spread the word, please. Voting closes at the end of this week and the conference is on two weeks after that.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to it. I hope you are too!
