I just gave a presentation on CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Separation) at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Alt-Net/">Sydney Alt.Net</a> group and have uploaded the slides to SlideShare for you to have a look at.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty simple pattern, but also one that can be quite powerful. It can also be the launching point for getting into Domain Driven Design and a gateway to more advanced architectural approaches such as event sourcing and microservices.<br /><br />That said, CQRS does not need to be used with those and is a valuable enough on its own to be included in every developers toolkit.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="485" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/GEmsW9ZLZTirt" style="border-width: 1px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" width="595"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/rbanks54/cqrs-and-what-it-means-for-your-architecture" target="_blank" title="CQRS and what it means for your architecture">CQRS and what it means for your architecture</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/rbanks54" target="_blank">Richard Banks</a></strong> </div><br />
