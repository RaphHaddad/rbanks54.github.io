If you've got an evil streak there are some parts of management that are fun.<br /><br />My staff have finally found this blog and have read an entry further below about their technical skills.  I'm getting an good deal of enjoymenty over the fact that none of them know if I'm talking about them or not.<br /><br />I wonder if I should post about a design patterns exercise I asked them to do recently.  Since I know they team is reading this I wonder if they want to comment :-)
