I've been recently looking through the <a href="http://www.learn247.net/">WeFly 247 DVD</a> from Microsoft (this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/msdn/vs2005/">link </a>is for ordering the kit in Australia). The DVD contains a whole heap of useful demos of the various .NET 2.0 functions (and optionally ships with the Visual Studio beta 2).<br /><br />Among the most interesting things I've seen (so far) was the Visual Studio tools for Office (I've mentioned this previously) and the overview of .NET 2.0 itself, with the demo of some of the cool features in Visual Studio Team System.<br /><br />The DVD itself contains a heap of other stuff, but I think the most interesting thing was the use of Producer for Powerpoint. This is a really cool (and free) utility that lets you record voice overs and video captures for powerpoint presentations that really makes powerpoint come alive as an online webcast tool. Producer can be obtained <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/producer/prodinfo/overview.mspx">here</a>.
