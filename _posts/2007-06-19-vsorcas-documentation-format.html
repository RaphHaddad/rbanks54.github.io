It appears I was slightly mistaken about what the new VSORCAS documentation format in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/">Sandcastle</a> actually is. It's actually a new "front end" to the documentation and for now is restricted just to documentation produced by Sandcastle itself (see the comment in <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2007/06/msdn-documentation-format-set-for.html">my previous blog post</a>).<br /><br />Anyway a new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/06/19/announcing-june-2007-sandcastle-ctp.aspx">Sandcastle CTP</a> has just been released and the new "VSORCAS" (bad name) output format is included.<br /><br />Here's what it looks like (click for larger image):<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_A2KlHI/AAAAAAAAACY/z93DcbH1Fds/s1600-h/sandcastle1.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077675522000589938" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_A2KlHI/AAAAAAAAACY/z93DcbH1Fds/s400/sandcastle1.png" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The use of tabs to only show specific syntaxes is quite nice and saves a fair bit of real estate. And the in line filtering of contents based on properties (private, public, etc) is useful when you have a large class you are looking at<br /><br />Here's a filtered view of the same class<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_Q2KlII/AAAAAAAAACg/KU5MRnMUYWo/s1600-h/sandcastle2.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077675526295557250" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_Q2KlII/AAAAAAAAACg/KU5MRnMUYWo/s400/sandcastle2.png" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Sandcastle also handles Generics quite nicely now as well, as can been seen in this method's documentation.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_Q2KlJI/AAAAAAAAACo/I_pm2eNd-0s/s1600-h/sandcastle3.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077675526295557266" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_Q2KlJI/AAAAAAAAACo/I_pm2eNd-0s/s400/sandcastle3.png" border="0" /></a><br /><br />While the documentation shown so far is HTML output, you also get the HxS output as well as CHM output, all of which exhibit the same behaviour. Here's a shot of the CHM output.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_Q2KlKI/AAAAAAAAACw/_j3TjTnlkHM/s1600-h/sandcastle4.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077675526295557282" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneG_Q2KlKI/AAAAAAAAACw/_j3TjTnlkHM/s400/sandcastle4.png" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Sandcastle is progressing nicely now, and appears to be a viable replacement to NDoc. It still needs more work (especially a GUI front end) but it's making good progress.<br /><br />Oh, I should also mention that there is another new format called "prototype" that acts much the same as the vsorcas format, but has a cleaner look and feel as shown here:<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneLMg2KlLI/AAAAAAAAAC4/G--qzDq9HNU/s1600-h/sandcastle5.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077680151975335090" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RneLMg2KlLI/AAAAAAAAAC4/G--qzDq9HNU/s320/sandcastle5.png" border="0" /></a>
