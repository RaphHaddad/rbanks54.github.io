<p>This is a quick one for a few guys I was talking with today.</p>  <p>One of the PITA things about Visual Studio 2008 / 2010 is that when you choose to have Visual Studio implement an interface for you it will generate the code inside a #region block.&#160; And why is that bad?&#160; Because regions suck! Feel free to start a religious wars over it, but let me just say that if I can’t see all the code when opening a source file and you make me click or press a hot key just to see a few lines of code it then I’m likely to go postal on you.&#160; With a rotting halibut and a cork.</p>  <p>So, if you want to avoid the ire of the region police then let me suggest a small settings change in Visual Studio.&#160; This one right here: (VS2010 screen shot shown)</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/TCCcjuYnWRI/AAAAAAAAAwI/2bGTu7sOKOw/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="484" height="282" /> </p>  <p>Is that obvious enough for you? Good! Now go ahead and make that change and start being nice to your fellow developers.</p>  <p>That will be all :-)</p>
