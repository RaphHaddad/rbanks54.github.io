Well, I just got home and checked the snail-mail and I had a nice little surprise from <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.  I now have a little cheque from  <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a> for A$137.75.<br /><br />For those of you who have clicked through the ads on this site - thankyou.  For those of you who hate them - sorry (but at least this site isn't flooded with ads as you see on some web sites).<br /><br />If you were wondering the money is going - it's headed straight into my <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com">Wii</a> fund where I'll be helping poor homeless games find a place to stay :-)
