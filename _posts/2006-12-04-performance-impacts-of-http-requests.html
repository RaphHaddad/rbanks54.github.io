<p>The <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/">Yahoo UI blog</a> has a good review of the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/28/performance-research-part-1/">performance impacts</a> of multiple HTTP requests.&nbsp; As you would expect, reducing the HTTP requests has a big impact on the web page performance.</p> <p>Unfortunately the post only talks about the problem.&nbsp; We have to wait for Part II to see what the impact of caching is and what the "surprising real-world" findings are.</p> <p>P.S. There's a Firefox utility called <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> that help do this sort of diagnosis (plus a whole bunch of other cool things)</p>
