here's an interesting little <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/business/soa/10_fatal_flaws_of_a_doomed_employee/0,139023749,339271526,00.htm?feed=rss">article</a> over at ZDNet listing 10 critical flaws of doomed employees.<br /><p>Read the article for the description of each item, but here's my take on the 10 flaws and what you should do about it (if the shoe fits, that is)...<br /><br /></p><ol><li><strong>Failing to have a life plan</strong><br />There's a claasic little saying - "Without a vision, the people perish".  No goals means you'll probably have little or no drive, no ambition, no joy of accomplishment, nothing to get up for each day, a sense of listlessness, etc. </li><li><strong>Not keeping your skill set current</strong><br />Out of date = out of work.    The best way to keep up to date is to read abuot new things, and then think about ways you could apply it to your current situation.  Failing that get yourself on training courses, buy books and resources, etc.  </li><li><strong>Failing to deliver results</strong><br />It's Scrum!  'nuff said.<br /></li><li><strong>Confusing efficiency with effectiveness</strong><br />Talk.  Ask Questions.  Communicate face to face.  Sounds a bit like pairing to me.  </li><li><strong>Believing that you are irreplaceable</strong><br />Don't confuse being replacable with not being valuable.  </li><li><strong>Knowing all the answers</strong><br />No one knows everything and pretending you do just annoys your colleagues.  </li><li><strong>Surrounding your self with "brown-nosers"</strong><br />"Yes men" are not supporters.  They're like groupies - they're there when things go well and vanish when things turn tough.<br /></li><li><strong>Forgetting to give credit to others</strong><br />People know those who do good work and those who don't.   Leave your ego at the door each day and support your team.<br /></li><li><strong>Failing to self promote</strong><br />Self promotion is not an ego trip if you do it humbly.  Note that Anthony Mundine style promotion probably won't work.  </li><li><strong>Losing perspective</strong><br />No (wo)man is an island.  Ask for opinions, seek advice, and remember the customer!<br /></li></ol> P.S. If you have 10 out of 10 of these flaws then you'd might want to update your resume
