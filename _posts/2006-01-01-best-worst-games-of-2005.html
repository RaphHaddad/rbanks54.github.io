Gamespot has released their best and worst <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=4">list</a> of games for 2005.  Having just played through Myst 5 in a bit over 10 hours, and also having completed the single player version of Call Of Duty 2 in about the same time (on regular) I thought it would be interesting to see what the "experts" have to say...<br /><br />I may not agree with all the winners, but I'd say the finalists are all genuine contenders, and it looks like I'll have to go see if the local EB Games has a copy of Indigo Prophecy in stock :-)
