<p>There's a lot of people out there who claim to be agile, however it's so easy to bandy about the A-word these days that it's almost impossible to know if a team is just a bunch of cowboys, wether they're just using trying to fit a waterfall process into an agile time frame (agilefall) or if they are actually doing things properly.</p> <p>Nokia (yes, the phone company) runs Scrum internally and developed a simple test to determine how agile a team really is.</p> <p>It's a test in 2 parts.&nbsp; Part one focuses on iterative development and part two on how well you are doing Scrum.</p> <p>Here it is:</p> <p>First, are you doing iterative development? <ul> <li>Iterations must be time boxed to less than 4 weeks. <li>Software features must be tested and working at the end of each iteration. <li>The iteration must start before specifications are complete.</li></ul> <p>Second, are you doing Scrum? <ul> <li>You know who the Product Owner is  <li>There is a product backlog prioritised by business value  <li>The product backlog has estimates created by the team  <li>The team generates burndown charts and knows their velocity  <li>There are no project managers (or anyone else) disrupting the work of the team </li></ul> <p>Note that the Product Owner question relates to having an individual product owner - it doesn't say "You know who the Product Owners are".&nbsp; I've seen teams with two masters trying to do agile and they only ever have problems.</p> <p>I also find it interesting that there is nothing in the test about having retrospectives, especially as one of the agile principles is the "inspect &amp; adapt" loop, but apart from that it's a good test.&nbsp; In any case, if a team gets 8 out of 8 in this test then they're most likely doing retrospectives any way.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So why don't you take the test.&nbsp; How does your team score?</p>
