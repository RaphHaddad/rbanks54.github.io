<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/">Sandcastle</a> will be getting a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/06/21/sandcastle-june-refresh-with-renamed-documentation-design-and-model.aspx">refresh of the June CTP</a> shortly and will change the name of VSORCAS layout to avoid confusion between the documentation format in VS2008 and the new Sandcastle documentation layout style.<br /><br />Many thanks to the Sandcastle team for listening to feedback and making changes so quickly.  Especially since I didn't actually contact them directly, and just made a comment in my blog about it.<br /><br />The team also blogged about some of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/06/21/sandcastle-customer-projects.aspx">community tools for Sandcastle</a>, including a link to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB">SFHB</a> - a GUI front end to build documentation with Sandcastle, similar to what NDoc had.<br /><br />There's also links to another <a href="http://www.inchl.nl/SandcastleGUI/">GUI front end</a> and a tool for <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/DocProject">MSBuild/VS2005 integration</a>.<br /><br />Very good stuff.
