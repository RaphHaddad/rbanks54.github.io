<p>The <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/" target="_blank">Sydney Alt.Net User Group</a> is on tomorrow night (RSVP if you’re coming!) and as we creep up on 2 years of running I was thinking about how the group is progressing.&#160; Personally I really enjoy the group.&#160; I’ve learned heaps and I love hanging out with everyone but at the same time I wonder about the fact that the numbers are consistently between 20 and 30 and if there’s something I can do to increase the audience, or if it’s just the nature of the Sydney community.&#160; After all there are so many other groups on during the month, plus it’s winter right now and with Sydney being such a large city travel may also be a factor. Even so, maybe there are things I can do to bring in more people.</p>  <p>So what do I do?&#160; I turn to Google and ask for help, of course.&#160; That said, I’m not really sure I want to take up the advice – while it might be an enjoyable way to get some free association and new happening I’m not sure I really want to go down that path :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/TChdgt9aeyI/AAAAAAAAAwY/7cjwfWF6Qk8/s1600-h/image%5B4%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/TChdhYK67KI/AAAAAAAAAwc/asaJih6DbKA/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="394" height="151" /></a></p>
