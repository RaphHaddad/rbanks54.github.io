I'm off to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/teched2006/">Tech.Ed</a> this week with a few of my team.  Should be an interesting time and I'm looking forward to seeing how some of the presentations go (especially in terms of style and content, etc) and trying to figure out what new stuff is useful for our application, and what is just fluff.<br /><br />Follow up posts will come after the event (and after I've digested it all).
