Tonight I wrapped up my job with MXL, and got a very nice sendoff (though they did make sure I left the building!)<br /><br />It's a weird feeling - for the past 2 years I've been investing a lot of time, energy and emotion into my staff and now I'm leaving all that behind and hoping it continues on without me.  Whilst I'm excited to be starting something new at the same time I'm kind of depressed about leaving my team and the fact that I won't get to see them every (working) day anymore.<br /><br />In some respects it feels a bit like leaving high school. Ah well, times change and people move on.  Here's wishing everyone the best with their futures.<br /><br />Tomorrow is a new day and tomorrow sees me start at Readify.  That's something to look forward to!
