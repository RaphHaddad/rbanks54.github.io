<p>You may have noticed that I’ve done a bit of a visual refresh on the blog.&nbsp; The old theme was getting a little long in the tooth, so I went hunting and found a new template to run with (details in the footer).&nbsp; I think this one looks much better than the old and it only required a little hacking and slashing to get it into the shape I wanted.</p> <p>For those who only see this blog via RSS you obviously won’t have noticed the change, so feel free to click on through and see what the new site looks like.</p> <p>There’s been one other change as well.&nbsp; Blogger introduced a “new” feature a while ago where the comment form can be embedded in a post so that you don’t need to use that annoying comment form.&nbsp; Yes, they were about 3 years behind everyone else, but at least they got there.&nbsp; You should now see a comment entry box at the end of each post where you can add your thoughts and 2-cents worth.&nbsp; So why don’t you give the new comment thing a go and tell me what you think of the new look and feel.</p>
