I hate powerpoint presentations.  They're typically boring, information crowded and lack any real punch.  I also have to use powerpoint as a regular part of my job in order to convey information in either pre-sales presentations or to communicate with the rest of the department or business.<br /><br />I've just stumbled across the <a href="http://www.beyondbullets.com/">Beyond Bullets</a> web site which has a number of useful tips, however the thing that blew me away was a link to a presentation about Identity 2.0 that shows how powerpoint can be used to it's maximum.  Have a look at this link <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/</a> and be inspired.
