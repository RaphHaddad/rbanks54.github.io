Part of this training involves teaching the developers, who are very familiar with centralised version control, how to use Git.</p> <p>What we have found is that explaining git concepts by drawing pictures on whiteboards and waving our hands around in the air works, but only to a point.</p> <p>To try and alleviate this problem Tatham put together a great little tool over the past two days that provides a way for people to see what is happening in their git repository as they work, in real time. Now we students can see what git is doing simply by using the commands and visualising the repository changes with GitViz&nbsp; How cool is that!</p> <p>Even better, itâ€™s all open source which means you can head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Readify/GitViz" target="_blank">GitHub project</a> to grab the code yourself, submit pull requests or simply make suggestions for improvements. We hope you enjoy it!</p>
