<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> has <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/04/linkedin_and_th.html">recently posted</a> about using <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for vetting candidates and tied it to "The No A$$hole Rule" book. The result is a fairly interesting read, especially as I'm a boss.<br /><br />How would I answer the list of items I wondered? Here's my self assessment, out in public, for the whole word to see. If you know me feel free to comment, though of course I'll probably abuse you and call you names :-)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Q1: Kisses-up and kicks-down:</strong> “How does the prospective boss respond to feedback from people higher in rank and lower in rank?”<br /><em>A1: Fairly well. I usually seek feedback from both my staff and boss. From the staff during reviews, from my boss at semi-regular intervals.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q2: Can’t take it:</strong> “Does the prospective boss accept criticism or blame when the going gets tough?”<br /><em>A2: Yep, I'll put my hand up when I make a mistake. Here's a </em><a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/02/organizational-change-and-scrum.html"><em>public example</em></a><em>.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q3: Short fuse:</strong> “In what situations have you seen the prospective boss lose his temper?”<br /><em>A3: Guilty on this one, though improving (slowly). I've lost my temper 3 times in the last 2 years, that I recall, and it's always been caused by a slow buildup of frustration that eventually erupts. I'm neither happy or proud about it.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q4: Bad credit:</strong> “Which style best describes the prospective boss: gives out gratuitous credit, assigns credit where credit is due, or believes everyone should be their own champion?”<br /><em>A4: Credit where it's due.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q5: Canker sore:</strong> “What do past collaborators say about working with the prospective boss?”<br /><em>A5: Nice things I hope - <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13321238&postID=278181298672845137">leave a comment</a>. The fact that some people have followed me from previous organisations is probably a good sign.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q6: Flamer:</strong> What kind of email sender is the prospective boss?<br /><em>A6: Flaming is rare - email is too easy to misinterpret so I try to keep things emotionless.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q7: Downer:</strong> “What types of people find it difficult to work with the prospective boss? What type of people seem to work very well with the prospective boss?”<br /><em>A7: It's hard to work with me if you don't think for yourself or show little initiative. I like people to be results driven, good communicators, ego-less and open with others.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q8: Card shark:</strong> “Does the prospective boss share information for everyone’s benefit?”<br /><em>A8: As much as I can. If things are in flux or sensitive in nature I'll withhold details, but once things settle and are clear I'll communicate what I can.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q9: Army of one:</strong> “Would people pick the prospective boss for their team?”<br /><em>A9: I hope so - <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13321238&amp;postID=278181298672845137">leave a comment</a>.</em><br /><br /><strong>Q10: Open architecture:</strong> “How would the prospective boss respond if a copy of the book appeared on her desk?”<br /><em>A10: I'll always accept freebies :-) Anyone got a copy they want to give me?</em><br /><em></em>
