<p>I’ve been quiet the last few weeks due to TechEd Australia coming up and my need to actually put together a session that flowed nicely, as well as getting through all the usual client work and so forth that was needed.&#160; Well, actually I was quiet on the blogging front, my <a title="Richard&#39;s Twitter Account" href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54" target="_blank">tweeting</a> continued as per usual (140 characters doesn’t take much time to bash out).</p>  <p>Yet again, TechEd Australia was a great personal experience for me.&#160; I delivered my unit testing session and got some great feedback (thanks to everyone who attended and put in an eval!), I also managed to record 5 episodes for the <a title="Talking Shop Down Under podcast" href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com" target="_blank">Talking Shop Down Under podcast</a>, did plenty of networking, including meeting the <a title="Dot Net Rocks podcast" href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank">DotNetRocks</a> guys as well as a bunch of other people I knew only via twitter, and I even attended some sessions and learnt some stuff.</p>  <p>For those interested, Microsoft should soon make my session available online and I’ll update this with the location once it goes live.</p>  <p>Update: The recording will be up at: <a href="http://www.msteched.com/2010/Australia/DEV362">http://www.msteched.com/2010/Australia/DEV362</a></p>
