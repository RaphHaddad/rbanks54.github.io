<p>At work we do almost all of our UI design mockups in Visio but because they're static it's sometimes hard to get a feel for what will really happen when people click on things and how usable it is.&nbsp; In other words it's easy enough to see if the "look" is right, but what about the "feel"?</p> <p>Well it turns out that you can emulate some limited interactivity using PowerPoint.&nbsp; I hadn't thought of doing that before until I ran across <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/02/20/535444.aspx">this blog entry</a> from one of the guys responsible for the Office user interface.&nbsp; It's pretty interesting and it might well be time to try it out :-)</p>
