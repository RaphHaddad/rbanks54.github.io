I've been playing around with smart clients recently, trying to evaluate the best way to make them work under .NET 2.0.<br /><br />After figuring it out I then ran across an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/smartclient/SmartClientSOA.asp">article</a> on the fabulous <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">codeproject</a> web site that describes how to put together a smart client that utilises a SOA to get data from a .NET 1.1 web services back end.<br /><br />It's a good read, well written and explains the concepts involved really well.  If you're a novice go and have a look.
