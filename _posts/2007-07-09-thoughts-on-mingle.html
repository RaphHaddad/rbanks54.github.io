<p>I've been playing around with an early access version of <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a> on and off for the past week (even if early access only means one month before the general public).</p> <p>I've got to say it's a really nice program. Yes there are a few minor quirks but it's a great tool for managing scrum&nbsp;<em>under the right conditions</em>.&nbsp; "What conditions are those?" I hear you ask. &nbsp;You need a team where most people are remote.&nbsp; If you've got a co-located team and everyone can be together at the same time then a tool like Mingle is, in my opinion,&nbsp;only useful for the Scrum Master (or project manager).&nbsp; Using a tool like this as the primary coordination tool for a team takes away from the essence of what makes Scrum, XP&nbsp;and other agile methodologies tick; that&nbsp;being the human interaction and team work that occurs when people are literally standing shoulder to shoulder&nbsp;working towards a common goal each day.&nbsp; The physical aspect of&nbsp;a wall covered in&nbsp;post-it notes and a half dozen team members standing within 3 feet of each other and communicating about those post-it notes can never be underestimated.</p> <p>Software like Mingle, <a href="http://www.scrumworks.com/">Scrumworks</a> and others remove the wall as the&nbsp;point of focus and try to replicate it on&nbsp;screen.&nbsp; Mingle even has a screen that looks just like a taskboard.&nbsp; But where's the collaboration or even the fun in crowding a team around someone's monitor and trying to update task descriptions or story cards in a software tool. And how often is that even going to happen in reality?</p> <p>That said, remote teams will get some benefit from Mingle.&nbsp; It's a good web based tool, quick and easy to use (and that's the most important thing), it keeps things in sync across team members, backlogs, etc , has a nice dashboard and looks to be an effective tool at managing backlogs and sprints without dictating exactly how those backlog items are delivered or how the sprints are run.&nbsp; For example, out of the box mingle includes project templates for XP, Scrum and "an agile hybrid".</p> <p>The one thing that bothers me is that there doesn't seem to be an obvious link between dates and iterations, or a concept of what the "current iteration" actually is.&nbsp; The iteration view shows all iterations unless you manually set a filter and that filter has to be set by individual team members.&nbsp; It just seems to me to be an oversight.</p>
