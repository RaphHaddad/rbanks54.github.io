It's been a very very busy week this past week (explaining the lack of posts).  I've been getting some work rushed out to meet some contractual deadlines and I've had the entire development team putting in the big ones to get things done.<br /><br />In agile/SCRUM terms this would definitely have been a sprint!  In any case, we've met the deadlines and things should now get back to normal.<br /><br />Normal blogging shall resume shortly :-)
