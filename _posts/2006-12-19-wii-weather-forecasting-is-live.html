I got home tonight and my <a href="http://www.wii.com"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Wii</span></a> had a blue glow around the disk slot.  Curious I turned it on and saw I had a mail message indicating that the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php">forecast channel was live</a>.  I clicked the update button, waited a few minutes and lo! and behold! there it is - weather forecasts on my <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Wii</span>.<br /><br />I simply had to tell it where I lived and I could then see the weather.  It shows the UV index, current temperature, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">todays</span> forecast, tomorrows forecast and a 5 day view.  You can also have a look at global weather.  It looks a bit different to what is <a href="http://uk.wii.com/movies/forecastchannel/">shown on the web site</a> but you can get the idea.<br /><br />It's kind of cool, but I think the most pleasing thing about this update was the way the <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">WiiConnect</span> 24 service works.  It's very unobtrusive with just a simple visual indicator that there's an update available.  I don't need to to check web sites, subscribe to mailing lists, or any of that business - just do the update and it's done.<br /><br />I'm guessing the same thing will happen when the news channel becomes available and that it will be another painless update.
