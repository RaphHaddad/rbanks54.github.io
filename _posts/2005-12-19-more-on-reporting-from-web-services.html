Still no luck on reporting via web services.  You can do the basics in many packages, but if you want to hook into a web service with WS-Security then you need to "roll your own" provider.<br /><br />I'm actually looking at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/technologies/reporting/default.mspx">SQL Reporting Services 2005</a> for it at the moment, since it also features the ability to provide "data models" to users allowing them to do ad-hoc queries from an understandable (in theory) representation of the business data and doesn't require them to understand SQL or web services or whatever the underlying data source is.<br /><br />I know it's proprietary, but I don't have a suitable alternative at the moment, and it's actually a nicely featured product.  Now to see if I can actually get it to work!
