<p>There’s a very funny response to a question on Quora doing the rounds at the moment.&#160; The question is “Why are software development task estimations regularly off by a factor of 2-3?”</p>  <p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Engineering-Management/Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3/answer/Michael-Wolfe" target="_blank">The response</a> (go ahead and read it) makes an analogy to hiking from San Francisco to Los Angeles to visit friends, underestimating the distance, terrain and rate of progress as well as encountering a number of impediments like the weather, colds, blisters and so forth.&#160; It’s a really good read.</p>  <p>It was mentioned on the <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/ozaltdotnet?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Australian Alt.Net mailing list</a>, this week and followed up with the question of <em>“so what do we learn from it?”</em></p>  <p>Two simple lessons come to mind.</p>  <h2>Lesson 1: It takes time to produce a reasonable estimate</h2>  <p>On any reasonable project don’t expect to be accurate if your estimate takes you less than 5 minutes to arrive at.&#160; In the example, it’s pretty obvious that little time was spent coming up with the estimate for how long the hike might take.&#160; Once they’d decided they were going to hike, taking time to estimate how long it would take was just stealing time from actually hiking!</p>  <p>As developers, we allow ourselves to do this all the time.&#160; “I like to write code, I don’t like to estimate. If I get the estimate done quick then I can get back to doing what I like.” </p>  <p>Stop it.&#160; You’re only storing up pain for yourself down the track.</p>  <h2>Lesson 2: Think about what might slow you down</h2>  <p>When you estimate think about what might slow you down.&#160; Very few teams do this but it’s critical if you want to be more realistic about how long something will take.</p>  <p>Most developers estimate with the same approach that they test their own code.&#160; They only consider the happy path.</p>  <p>You can hear them in their heads saying “It takes this long to do that. And that long to do that. And … then put it all together and the estimate is X months!!”.</p>  <p>Very few developers then say, “so the baseline is X months.&#160; Now what is likely to slow us down?”.&#160; Yet there are so many things that can do just that.</p>  <p>Want a basic list? How about the following:</p>  <ul>   <li>Have you done anything like this before?&#160; How vague are the requirements you have at the time of estimating?</li>    <li>How well do you know the technology you’re using?&#160; Or the design and techniques you’ll be implementing with?</li>    <li>How well do you know the people on your team? Are you all co-located? Can you communicate easily?</li>    <li>Does your team have all the skills you need to get the job done or will you have to rely on other’s being available?</li>    <li>How well do we know the problem you’re being asked to solve?</li>    <li>How well can you communicate with your customer(s)? How available will they be?</li>    <li>How bad are the worst people on your team and how much will they slow everyone down?</li>    <li>How’s team morale? Are people likely to leave mid project and take a whole lot of knowledge with them? How long would it take to replace them and get them up to speed?</li>    <li>How sucky is the code you’re working on?</li>    <li>How likely is it that people on the team will get pulled off on to other work? And how often?</li>    <li>If you’re estimating will you be doing the work? Or are you estimating on behalf of someone else without involving them?</li> </ul>  <p>That’s a starting list of things all teams should consider when estimating and all of those items should be used to take your “happy path” estimate and adjust it from there.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So next time you need to estimate something, keep these two simple lessons in mind and good luck!</p>
