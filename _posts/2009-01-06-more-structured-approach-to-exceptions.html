<p>Exception management.&nbsp; Ah, the two words that can so easily send shivers up the backs of many developers.&nbsp; And they are what they are, right?&nbsp; Wrap things in a try/catch and go from there.</p> <p>Well, Michael Feathers has just posted a blog entry on <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/01/05/abstracting-away-from-exceptions">a slightly different approach to exceptions</a> for those times where you want to be able to call a function and then handle any exceptions in a more structured way than just doing some inline processing (or swallowing them whole!).</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/01/05/abstracting-away-from-exceptions">Go have a look</a>, itâ€™s an interesting and simple approach and you could easily convert it to an extension method if you wanted to make your code just that little bit more intuitive.</p>
