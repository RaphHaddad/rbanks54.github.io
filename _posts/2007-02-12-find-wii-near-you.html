You've just gone and got yourself a nice shiny new Wii (well done by the way) and you've got it connected to the internet (maybe even using <a href="http://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php">the LAN adapter</a>) and now you want to find someone nearby that you can play with/against.<br /><br />What to do? What to do? Well, you could always go doorknocking in nearby streets, hang around at the local <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/">ebgames</a> store and ask people to play as they enter or leave the store (though you might get into trouble with the law) or you could put an ad in the local newspaper claiming how lonely you are and that you just want some meet some new Mii's, but they're probably not the best options you could choose.<br /><br />Then again, there's always <a href="http://mapwii.com/wii-number/index.cfm">MapWii</a>.  <a href="http://mapwii.com/">MapWii</a> is a pretty cool little mashup that links people with Wii's together.  You can register your location (as imprecisely as you like) and you'll turn up on their search page allowing you to be found by other people.  It's pretty cool and quite useful.  So, what  are you waiting for - get to it!
