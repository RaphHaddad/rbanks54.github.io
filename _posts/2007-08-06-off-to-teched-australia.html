This week I'm off to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/teched07/index.aspx">Tech.Ed</a> Australia. If you'll be there or you're on the Gold Coast and want to catch up, give me a shout.<br /><br />It should be lots of fun and who knows? I might even learn something.<br /><br />Tech.Ed is also going to be the official launch of <a href="http://www.tfsnow.com/">TFSNow</a> from <a href="http://www.readify.net/">Readify</a> (the company I work for).
