Paul Thurott (<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/office12_pb_galleries.asp">WinSuperSite</a>) has put some screenshots on his web site of the installation procedure for Office 12 and of Word 12 as well.<br /><br />The installation pictures are probably a hint as to what will happen with MSI v4, and the subtle visuals in the installation shots are really nice - very similar to the Aero visuals but in XP.<br /><br />The Word shots are also really enlightening. Apart from the new style toolbars (which look great) the menu's are really great - having tooltip style help showing under large menu items is a fantastic idea and really improves usability. Integration of the page zoom into the status bar and the use of a slider is also a great improvement in usability.<br /><br />Overall - Word is looking really good and it's great to see Microsoft willing to leave the old style design of office behind and take a fresh new approach.<br /><br />The only problem is now I'll have to rethink how the applications I develop look and feel as well. I guess you can't have it all...
