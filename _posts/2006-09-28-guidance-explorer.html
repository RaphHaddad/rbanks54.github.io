<p>The Microsoft patterns and practices team has just released a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=guidanceExplorer" mce_href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=guidanceExplorer">Guidance Explorer</a>. This is an easy way to find and lookup all the various how to's, samples and other goodies that come out of p&amp;p.</p><p>Best of all though, you can add our own stuff to it (though I'm not quite sure how yet). </p><p>There's an <a href="http://www.guidancelibrary.com/guidanceexplorerbeta/" mce_href="http://www.guidancelibrary.com/guidanceexplorerbeta/">online beta</a> (doesn't work in firefox, and it's a bit crappy in IE) and a downloadable copy.</p>The download is available from <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=bb9aecfe-56ba-4ca9-8127-44e551b90962">gotdotnet</a>, and installation is just a matter of unzipping into a folder and then creating a shortcut to the .exe.
