I just finished running a one day hackathon with a team I'm working with, instructing them to have a go at building anything they like.<br /><br />The results were pretty impressive. One team knocked together a web UI that mimics a screen from their desktop based application as well producing a WebGL based visualisation of data and events, another team cooked up an app featuring live updates of data across browsers using Firebase as the back end, and another team that decided they wanted to make their own build light.<br /><br />Not just any old build light, though. Oh, no, Nothing so mundane as that, They had to build one that not only goes green when the the build succeeds, but it also dispenses lollies! Awesome!<br /><br />I grabbed some video from my phone so you could see it in action. Enjoy! :-)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tR9BqifxiJU?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div>
