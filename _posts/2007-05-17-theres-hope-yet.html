If you've got a follicle-challenged head like me then there's really only a few things you can do:<br /><ol><li>Go bald (dis)gracefully</li><li>Shave everything off</li><li>Get a <a href="http://www.headcovers.com/item.php?cat=Hairpieces&next=0">toupee</a> or wig (Britney can help you here)<br /></li><li>Use <a href="http://www.onlyhairloss.com/glh/">Spray on Hair</a> (classy!)</li><li>Surgical methods</li></ol><br />Now it appears that <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/hair-regrown-in-baldness-breakthrough/2007/05/17/1178995264643.html">doctors have found a way</a> to get the body to regenerate hair long after the original follicles went into early retirement.  What's the catch?  Well apart from the fact that it's all still in the lab, there's this small rider: "the hair would still be subject to the conditions that made it fall out in the first place."<br /><br />I guess I'll stick with option 1 until they can sort the caveats out :-)
