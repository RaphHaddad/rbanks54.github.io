<p>Personally, I love <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>.&nbsp; Being able to write blog entries on the train is great, editing in your web logs styles is cool and&nbsp;it's also a neat way of capturing notes during meetings.</p> <p>Over the last few months there have been a number of occassions where the blogger beta changes have broken the live writer betas.&nbsp; The Live Writer team have done a great job in responding quickly when blogger changes break something else.&nbsp; They've also fixed an annoyance in using the keyboard to select sections of text (selecting text with shift+left would work, but moving back with shift+right wouldn't).</p> <p><a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!926.entry">Yet another update</a> for live writer is out which fixes the problems I was having <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/10/blogger-beta-and-windows-live-writer.html">previously</a>.&nbsp; It's also a little different in that it has a 1.0 version number (which is strange for a beta) and the install takes you to an <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/congrats">install-success</a> web page.</p> <p>Other than that - let's hope there's not many more breaking changes.&nbsp; Blogger beta is <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/11/blogger-beta-feature-complete.html">feature complete</a> so that should help things settle down somewhat - well, here's hoping anyway.</p> <p>For now - Back to train blogging again!! Yay!</p>
