Yes, it's true!  You can get it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft's IE page</a>.  Have fun :-)<br /><br />P.S. It's the English only release for now.<br /><br />Looks like <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 2</a> isn't far away either.  It's at RC3 and not far off it's RTM release.
