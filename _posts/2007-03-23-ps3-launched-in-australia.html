... and almost no one noticed. The midnight launch parties for the <a href="http://au.playstation.com/">PS3</a> overnight were spectacularly ignored. According to the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/games/crowds-go-mild-for-ps3/2007/03/23/1174153291466.html">SMH article</a> the (not so) massive 40 person strong "crowd" that turned up for the launch at the flagship Myer store in Sydney were outnumbered by the press.<br /><br />Dear, oh dear... What have Sony done?<br /><br />I posted about Sony <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/12/sony-ps3-plan-or-to-ruin-brand.html">ruining their brand</a> in December, but I never thought it would be this bad.<br /><br />One small positive note, they did supposedly pre-sell 20,000 units (though it might have only been <a href="http://www.palgn.com.au/article.php?id=7065">10,000</a>) and at $1,000 per unit, that's some serious money. Of course, both the <a href="http://www.wii.com/">Wii</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/">360</a> both broke 30,000 units at launch.
