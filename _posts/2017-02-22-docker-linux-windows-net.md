Last week I was at [Microsoft's Ignite Australia](https://msftignite.com.au/) conference where I presented three different talks.

This talk is about Docker and the various things you might want to think about, including the differences between Windows and Linux containers, orchestration engines, dockerising an existing .NET app, debugging an app running in a container, and more.

Slides are availabe from [https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/ARC326](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/ARC326)
