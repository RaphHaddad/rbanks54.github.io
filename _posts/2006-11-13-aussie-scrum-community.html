Well, kind of...<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/">Australian Scrum Community</a> is a new shared blog with a focus on all things <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">Scrum</a> (as in <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a>, not <a href="http://www.rugby.com.au/">union</a> or <a href="http://www.nrl.com.au/">league</a>).   They even <a href="http://www.scrum.com.au/2006/11/10/case-study-implementing-scrum">linked</a> to one of my <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/10/scrum-9-months-on.html">posts</a> :-)<br /><br />It would be nice to have some sort of membership or sign up system, but since it's relatively I'm willing to give it some time.  It's a great idea by the guys behind it and here's hoping it takes off.
