<p>Today saw the start of this weeks <a href="http://www.readify.net/rdn.aspx" target="_blank">RDN</a> <a href="http://www.readify.net/rdncalendar.aspx" target="_blank">sessions</a>.&nbsp; In Sydney this morning Wendy Richard's provided a good overview of ASP.NET AJAX and <a href="http://msmvps.com/greglow/" target="_blank">Greg Low</a> talked through what's coming up for SQL Server 2008.</p> <p>The SQL 2008 session in particular was really informative and provided a good insight into what the SQL Server team is doing with the product, including query enhancements, storage improvements, the upcoming Spatial data type and the Date and Time data types (yay!), how the release cycle will work and a whole lot more.&nbsp; Invaluable stuff for anyone who works with an SQL database (that's most of us!).</p> <p>If you haven't yet booked into an RDN session then I strongly suggest you do.&nbsp; The value in these sessions is huge and the only cost is your time.&nbsp; What a great return on investment :-)</p>
