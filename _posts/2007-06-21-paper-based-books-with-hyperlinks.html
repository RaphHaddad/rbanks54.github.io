I don't quite know what to make of this.  There's a prototype of a product called <a href="http://www.booktwo.org/notebook/the-bluebook/">The Bluebook</a> which is basically a normal paper based book printed with conductive ink.<br /><br />In the back of it (or embedded in the jacket/spine) is a bluetooth chip.  When you put your finger on an outlined section of text, the book sends a message to a nearby PC to do something, i.e. open a web page, play a music file or video, delete the contents of you hard disk, etc.<br />Have a look at the <a href="http://www.booktwo.org/notebook/the-bluebook/">web site</a> for some pictures of it and you'll get the idea.<br /><br />There's a range of kids books that use a similar concept (the <a href="http://www.leapfrog.com/Primary/GradeSchool/LeapPad.jsp?bmLocale=en_US">Leap Pad</a> series) that works of spatial recognition and plug in cartridges instead of bluetooth/pc links.  They work fairly well because the system is self contained and it's portable.<br /><br />I don't know about the Bluebook though - reading a book within 10 feet of a PC is not my idea of fun.  I think <a href="http://www.eink.com/">electronic ink</a> might be a better basis for this sort of thing - just because the <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/">Sony Reader</a> hasn't been successful doesn't mean the idea is wrong (anyone remember the state of mp3 players before the iPod?).
