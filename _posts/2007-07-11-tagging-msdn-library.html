The MSDN Library has been offering Wiki like functionality for quite a while now (though I'm yet to see it really used).  What's interesting is that this week the library will be <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/07/10/tagging-feature-to-be-launched-in-msdn-library.aspx">open for tagging</a>.<br /><br />This opens up all sorts of potential in terms of categorising information in a way that is much more useful for people, beyond just the TOC type of organisation that is currently provided by Microsoft.<br /><br />I'm really curious to see how this pans out, and I'm sure I'll be having a good look at it as soon as it becomes available.  Hopefully this sort of thing will eventually make it's way into Sandcastle as well - I could imagine the use of <tag/> tags in the XML comments flowing through to the rendered documentation as something that could be really useful.
