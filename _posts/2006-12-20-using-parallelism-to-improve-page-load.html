<p>There's an interesting post at <a href="http://www.ajaxperformance.com/">Ajax Performance</a> about the <a title="Circumventing Browser Connection Limits for Fun and Profit" href="http://www.ajaxperformance.com/?p=33">inbuilt browser limits</a> on the number of connections per host and how increasing that limit can help improve page load times.</p> <p>If you serve up a fair amount of static content in your web applications/sites then this is a performance tip that is probably worth considering.&nbsp; Especially when you consider that the load times in their sample improved by 40% !</p>
