<p><a href="http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Darren</a> recently posted about <a href="http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!15630F96CB7D86C1!702.entry" target="_blank">getting help through networking</a>.&nbsp; I hadn't actually seen his post when I drafted the following, but it's really quite useful.&nbsp; If you don't have a good network of people you can ask questions of then go and have a read (in fact, go have a read of it anyway). <p>---- <p>&lt;Ad Voice&gt; <p>Want to know the answer to a technical problem and you want it fast? <p>Want advice on how to get around that tricky widget architecture design problem you’ve been scratching your head about? <p>Customer wants you to help with something you’ve never seen before in your life? <p>Coffee stains turning your teeth brown? <p>Well – look no further!!&nbsp; Your answers are here!! <p>&lt;/Ad Voice&gt; <p>In all seriousness (or as serious as I can get) if you want answers to something then here’s your choices in increasing order of effectiveness. <h4>Reference Docs</h4> <p>Go to the MSDN docs (or the manual for whatever you have a problem with).&nbsp; It's OK if you know what you’re looking for – terrible if you don’t.&nbsp; And if you knew what you were looking for you wouldn’t have a question now, would you? <h4>Search Engine</h4> <p>Type a search phrase into Google.&nbsp; Wade through 1,763,209 pages for that needle in a haystack.&nbsp; Get confused with all the results, waste 3 hours. <h4>Forums &amp; Mailing Lists</h4> <p>If Phone-A-Friend fails (see below) and there’s no answer on that phone thingy, they’re busy, they don’t know, etc - then ask a forum or mailing list.&nbsp; <em>[You might want to use MSDN forums, ASP.NET forums, mailing lists, or whatever else is appropriate for you]</em> <p>It’s what they're for.&nbsp; Don't be a lurker and remember that the more active you are, the more you'll get known by others and the more likely you are to grow your network of contacts. <p>Give it a little time though - people might not always have an answer at the ready&nbsp; (they might be busy, or they don’t know either) and if your question spawns an off-topic thread, feel free to slap people silly with a wet mackerel and bring it back to the question at hand. <p>Oh, try and maintain a sense of humour as well, and be aware that in large forums there will be a number of differing opinions. <p>Most importantly, don't just receive help, give it as well.&nbsp; And always show your thanks and appreciation to those that offer assistance. <h4>Phone-A-Friend</h4> <p>This is by far the best option.&nbsp; Here’s how it works: <p>Think of someone who has dealt in the area you have a question in. <p>Ask them!! <p>I know, I know!&nbsp; It's just like rocket science! <p>I also know that asking questions can be really difficult at times – so here's are a number of handy tools you can use to get over your fear of talking. <p>Send an email: <p><a href="http://lh6.google.com/rbanks54/R6abOgBBN1I/AAAAAAAAAOQ/CzAqUVJlAZA/clip_image004%5B5%5D"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="111" alt="clip_image004" src="http://lh4.google.com/rbanks54/R6abPABBN2I/AAAAAAAAAOY/D-U5k-PMVnY/clip_image004_thumb%5B2%5D" width="283" border="0"></a> <p>Send an instant message: <p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/rbanks54/R6abPwBBN3I/AAAAAAAAAOg/HmxE5db9Tfs/clip_image008%5B7%5D"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="210" alt="clip_image008" src="http://lh5.google.com/rbanks54/R6abQQBBN4I/AAAAAAAAAOo/bTKjZpfUYtE/clip_image008_thumb%5B4%5D" width="244" border="0"></a> <p>Or, if you are feeling brave, use a phone: <p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/rbanks54/R6abQwBBN5I/AAAAAAAAAOw/eHdhDEafycY/clip_image010%5B3%5D"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="244" alt="clip_image010" src="http://lh5.google.com/rbanks54/R6abRQBBN6I/AAAAAAAAAO4/Mb-xQn5yLgI/clip_image010_thumb" width="138" border="0"></a> <p>(I know – it's scary using that phone thing isn’t it!) <p>Is that clear enough?&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp; Now, go get networking and get those answers you seek :-) <p>&nbsp; <p>P.S. I'm more than happy to be a part of your network - feel free to invite me.</p>
