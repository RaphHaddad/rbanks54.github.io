<p><a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2007/08/would-you-take-on-this-project.html">My last post</a> included a picture of a clock which I wanted on the right of the text so naturally I used a css inline style to float the image to the right.&nbsp; The HTML is pretty simple</p><pre class="codeblock">&lt;IMG style="FLOAT: right" alt="clock" src="http://static.flickr.com/1115/1284040636_308c3d584d.jpg" border="0" /&gt;<br /></pre><br /><p>Nothing too dramatic about that. OK,&nbsp;yes, so the inline style would upset the purists, but still... it's just an IMG tag right?&nbsp; What can go wrong? Well, apparently a lot. Here's how the image appeared when I viewed the blog post in Internet Explorer 7:</p><br /><p>&nbsp;<a title="guillotine in IE7" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/1285032891/"><img alt="guillotine in IE7" src="http://static.flickr.com/1311/1285032891_295fc71375.jpg" border="0"></a></p><br /><p>What!&nbsp; The image is chopped off!!&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet&nbsp;space for the image is still there and the tool tips work when hovering over the image space as well. It's like it's floating, but partially hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I checked how it looked in Firefox</p><br /><p>&nbsp;<a title="guillotine in ffox" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/1285033099/"><img alt="guillotine in ffox" src="http://static.flickr.com/1312/1285033099_b917334a9b.jpg" border="0"></a></p><br /><p>Hmm.&nbsp; It's working there OK.&nbsp; Maybe it's an IE7 problem.&nbsp; So I had a look at the post using Google Reader (In IE7):</p><br /><p>&nbsp;<a title="guillotine in IE7 reader" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/1285893570/"><img alt="guillotine in IE7 reader" src="http://static.flickr.com/1134/1285893570_704d4303d4.jpg" border="0"></a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;Well, that's just strange.&nbsp; It appears OK in Reader using IE7 but not in the blog?&nbsp; What's going on here?</p><br /><p>Well, a quick search on Google turned up a problem I'd never heard of.&nbsp; The "guillotine bug" for IE.&nbsp; This is a rendering bug in IE that occurs based on certain rather weird conditions.&nbsp; Check out the information on <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/guillotine.html" target="_blank">positioniseverything</a> and <a href="http://css-class.com/articles/explorer/guillotine/index.htm" target="_blank">css-class</a> for more details.&nbsp; The <a href="http://css-class.com/articles/explorer/guillotine/index.htm">css-class article</a> also includes 6 live examples of the bug at work. It's really a very&nbsp;interesting read and yet at the same time it's a really sad indictment on the IE team that it even exists.</p><br /><p>Unfortunately the one useful fix that's mentioned is to add a "clear:both" to a &lt;div/&gt; following from the&nbsp;HTML block that has the problem and my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> template already has this in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;That means there must be something else going on.</p><br /><p>A bit more&nbsp;searching later turned up this <a href="http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/70426" target="_blank">forum entry at incutio</a>.</p><br /><p>After skimming through the rather bizarre browser workarounds being talked about I saw something about IE working when there is a <em>position: relative</em> css property.</p><br /><p>Well, that's a pretty easy thing to try.&nbsp; So I changed the IMG tag to </p><pre class="codeblock">&lt;IMG style="FLOAT: right; <span style="background-color: #eeeeaa">position: relative;</span>" alt="clock" src="http://static.flickr.com/1115/1284040636_308c3d584d.jpg" border="0" /&gt;<br /></pre><br /><p>&nbsp;And, lo! And behold! Floating images that don't get chopped in IE7 (and that still work in Firefox).</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You know, sometimes, I just hate IE.&nbsp; Grrrr.</p>
