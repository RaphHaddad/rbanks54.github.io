<p>This should be a fun week.&#160; Tomorrow and Wednesday I’ll be attending the Visual Studio 2010 launch and speaking at the Australian ALM conference (<a href="http://www.australianalm.com.au">http://www.australianalm.com.au</a>) with sessions on unit testing with VS2010 and lessons from agile implementations.</p>  <p>I’m also aiming to record a number of episodes for the <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/" target="_blank">Talking Shop Down Under</a> podcast whilst I have the opportunity to collar a bunch of people in person.</p>  <p>If you’re going to be there, keep and eye out for me and say hello (and attend both the VIS03 and ALM05 sessions!).&#160; See you there!</p>
