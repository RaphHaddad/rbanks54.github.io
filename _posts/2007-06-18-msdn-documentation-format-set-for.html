<p>Looks like the upcoming Orcas release of visual studio will have a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/06/17/introducing-a-new-document-model-design-code-named-vsorcas.aspx">new documentation format</a>.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well let me quote: "<em>This new documentation presentation layer targets developer audience who need to find information quickly and easily in our documentation that grows significantly with every Visual Studio/.NET Framework release.</em>"</p> <p>If you've ever spent more than 3.75 secs looking for information in the 2005 MSDN Library&nbsp;help system looking for anything more esoteric than the syntax for an <em>if</em> statement can be frustrating.</p> <p>What's even better is that this search "if statement c#" doesn't even return a relevant result the if-else statement in the top 5 results - it's the 8th on the list!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Below&nbsp;the top 3 ranked results&nbsp;of&nbsp;"lock statement (C#)", "using statement (C#)" and "fixed Statement (C#)".&nbsp; Any improvement will be of value after that little effort!</p> <p>My concern though, is that the changes listed for the MSDN documentation don't seem to address the real problem.&nbsp; The changes are about disk space, screen scrolling and views, and filtering and restricting search contexts.&nbsp; They don't seem to have realised that filtering doesn't improve relevancy, it just hides the problem.&nbsp; I'll wait and see how the beta's look, but at this stage I'm not that hopeful of any greatly improved usefulness - google will probably stay as the main source of MSDN docs for now.</p> <p>By the way the first 5 results for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=if+statement+c%23&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1">"if statement c#" on Google</a> are all about the if statement - including the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5011f09h(VS.71).aspx">MSDN documentation entry</a> for the if-else statement.</p>
