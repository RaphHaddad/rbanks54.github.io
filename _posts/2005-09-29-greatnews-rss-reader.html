In the past I've used FeedReader to keep track of RSS feeds, mainly because of it's ability to minimise to the system tray, but I've recently gotten a bit sick of it.  It doesn't handle all the feeds that well and it keeps thinking the MSDN feeds have been refreshed when only one or two new articles are posted.
<br />
<br />So I went looking and eventually came across <a href="http://www.curiostudio.com/">GreatNews</a>.  It's a real pleasure to use, is quick and has a nice clean interface (with multiple layouts as well).
<br />
<br />If you feel like a change, try it out.
