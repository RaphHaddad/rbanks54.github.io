<p>Maybe it’s just the teams I’m helping but there seems to be a spate of analysis paralysis occurring in the IT world.&#160; Of course if I was a media outlet I be calling it an breakout, nay an epidemic! No! A pandemic!! Run for the hills people we might all be infected!!!</p>  <p>If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms then see the guidelines below:</p>  <ul>   <li>Analysis has taken more than a month already and shows no sign of ending anytime soon</li>    <li>The documentation you’ve written has fine grained details in a few areas and is completely lacking any information at all in others (especially the tricky bits)</li>    <li>Your analysis efforts are going around in circles</li>    <li>No one can decide what the “right” approach is to some of the problems</li> </ul>  <p>Steps for curing this disease:</p>  <ol>   <li>Stop analysing!! Right now!</li>    <li>Write some code based on what you have done.</li>    <li>When that code is working, go and analyse/design a little bit more.</li>    <li>Go back to point 2</li> </ol>  <p>Good luck with the cure and I hope your health improves!</p>
