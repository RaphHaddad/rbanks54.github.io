<p>For those of you who aren't yet using <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> (or haven't heard of it) you can have a look at a <a href="http://files.jnewland.com/firebug.mov">screencast</a> of it to see what it can do.&nbsp; <a href="http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2006/12/08/firebug-10-screencast">Jesse Newland</a> put it together, and even though it's pretty short it shows some very, very cool things.</p> <p>P.S.&nbsp;It's a <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime">Quicktime</a> movie.</p> <p>I think it might be time to make this thing mandatory for all developers</p>
