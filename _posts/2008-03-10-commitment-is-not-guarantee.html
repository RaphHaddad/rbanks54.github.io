<p>When using Scrum for the development process a team begins an iteration by sitting with the Product Owner and working through which items from the product backlog they can complete by the end of the iteration.&nbsp; The team then makes a commitment to deliver on those items and gets to work.</p> <p>What sometimes happens is that a Product Owner will assume that the commitment by the team is a guarantee that everything will be delivered.&nbsp; Even if they know better, when a team has delivered a number of successful iterations in a row it's very easy for a Product Owner to lapse into this thinking.</p> <p>The commitment by the team is a statement that they are devoting themselves to getting all of the items in the sprint backlog "done".&nbsp; But it is not a guarantee - a guarantee is a statement along the lines of "if we don't do this then we will ..." with some sort of remediation or punishment clause at the end.&nbsp; So if a team guaranteed delivery then they would also be saying that there are potential remedies for not delivering, but what could those be? Docking of pay and/or working overtime? There's not much else is there? And the thing is, by the time an iteration concludes there isn't any more time left - overtime just eats into the next iteration and overtime itself doesn't resolve every problem, almost always creates new ones and gives birth to a tired team that makes more mistakes and takes longer to get things done.</p> <p>So what does a Scrum Master do when a team has been unable to deliver on all their items?</p> <p>First - do a retrospective and see what lessons can be learned.&nbsp; Did the team work cohesively? Were there external dependencies that impeded the team? Did anyone on the team slack off?&nbsp; Were there things forgotten during estimation? Unseen gotcha's? Ask the team - learn what you can, and take those lessons into the next iteration.</p> <p>Second - talk to the Product Owner and adjust expectations for following iterations.&nbsp; Explain to the Product Owner what went wrong, and what changes the team are making to address them and then reduce the teams velocity.</p> <p>Note: punishing a team for missing a delivery is generally counter-productive.&nbsp; They'll already feel bad enough for missing the target so don't pour more salt on the wound as it can be a demotivator.&nbsp; Talk to the team, keep encouraging them, find out what happened and see if you can help them make the changes they want to.&nbsp; Help them learn their lessons, communicate with the Product Owner and stakeholders about expectations and move on with delivering on the next iteration.</p>
