<p>Close on the heels of TechEd Australia, <a href="http://www.readify.net">Readify</a> have announced the latest Dev Days events for both Sydney and Melbourne.</p>  <p>When we last ran these we had multiple tracks which presented tough choices on what to see at times, so weâ€™ve changed things around and will now run separate morning and afternoon tracks instead.&#160; It means you can now get to everything, or just come for the half day session you are interested in and go to the beach for the other half of the day (or do some work if you must).</p>  <p>I'll be presenting the morning session in Sydney, covering <strong>Software Quality and Application Lifecycle Management</strong> split across two subjects:</p>  <ul>   <li>Gathering Quality Requirements for Agile Development Teams, and an </li>    <li>Introduction to Visual Studio Team System 2010.</li> </ul>  <p>In the afternoon, <a href="http://blog.tatham.oddie.com.au/" target="_blank">Tatham Oddie (MVP)</a> will be covering <strong>Building for the Web with .NET</strong> through three different presentations:</p>  <ul>   <li>Building Fast, Standards Compliant ASP.NET Websites, </li>    <li>ASP.NET MVC: Building for the web, and an </li>    <li>Introduction to the ASP.NET Web Forms Model-View-Presenter framework. </li> </ul>  <p>To find out more or to book just point your browser to <a href="http://readify.net/training-and-events/rdn-dev-days/">http://readify.net/training-and-events/rdn-dev-days/</a>.&#160; See you there!</p>
