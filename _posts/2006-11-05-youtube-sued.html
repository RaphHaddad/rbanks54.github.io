I've <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/10/gootube-update.html">posted</a> <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-and-youtube-silliness.html">previously</a> about <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">GooTube</span> and the litigation potential.  We'll <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/utube-sues-youtube/2006/11/02/1162339964137.html">it's apparently started</a> - but this is kinda left field and not at all what I expected.<br /><br /><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">YouTube</span> is not being sued for copyright infringement, but because their name is so similar to a manufacturing company's name and the company has had to keep moving their web site because it gets flooded by people who can't tell the difference between <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">YouTube</span> and <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">UTube</span>.<br /><br />Still, I bet this wouldn't have happened if Google didn't buy out <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">YouTube</span>.  Given that <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">UTube</span> has already moved their web site a number of times previously, ask yourself what's changed this time to make them get all litigious?
