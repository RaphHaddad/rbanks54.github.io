<p>I have to wonder at times what goes through designer’s heads and wether they use their own products.&#160; Have a look at the following keyboard for a HP machine I’ve been given to use when on site.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/TE5PddiiMoI/AAAAAAAAAxk/TL8V-4PRvu8/s1600-h/IMG_0089%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0089" border="0" alt="IMG_0089" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/TE5Pe_UR-qI/AAAAAAAAAxo/iNCY0EuHJmc/IMG_0089_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="484" height="364" /></a> </p>  <p>Look at the size of that Shift key on the left there. The thing is about half it’s normal size, which of course means I keep hitting the key next to it far too often and screwing up my typing.&#160; I have to train my hands to perform more finger gymnastics than is normal, and can’t easily slide my left thumb into position like I normally would (maybe I shouldn’t use my thumb for shift, but it’s a habit I’ve picked up from gaming and it’s hard to overcome).</p>  <p>But&#160; maybe there’s a reason why they did it.&#160; A reason why they cut the left shift key in half but kept the right hand one full sized?&#160; Oh, there’s it is! It’s so they could add an extra (and duplicated) key on the keyboard! I for one know that the backslash and pipe characters are easily the most commonly used ones in my arsenal.&#160; On my laptop the backslash key is so worn away from use I can hardly make out the symbols on it any more.&#160; It’s worse than even the ‘e’ and return keys!&#160; Thank goodness keyboard usability was sacrificed to add an extra one of those puppies!&#160; Thank you HP! Thank you!</p>  <p>OK. Rant over.&#160; Time to go steal a keyboard from someone else in the office, and while I do that why don’t you let me know what the most annoying keyboard design is that you’ve used or seen?</p>
