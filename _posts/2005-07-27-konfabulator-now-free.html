<a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> has been purchased by Yahoo and they've now made it available for free.
<br />
<br />This is great news (at least for me) as I've been using a Mac recently for cross browser compatibility testing and I've kind of fallen in love with the Dashboard (which was ripped off from Konfabulator).
<br />
<br />Needless to say, it's downloaded now and I'm perusing the available widgets for the ones that interest me (of which there are a few).  Happy days!
