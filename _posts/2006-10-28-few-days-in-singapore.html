I'm off to Singapore tomorrow to present at an industry forum with a colleague.<br /><br />There'll be around 100-120 people attending and I get to speak in front of them all.  As you would expect, I'll be taking a powerpoint presentation with me, but I'm leaving those sleep inducing bullet points and eye cluttering corporate branded master slides way behind.<br /><br />It's time to take my "enlightened" presentation style on the road and see how it goes.  It should be fun.<br /><br />One thing I'm glad of, the presentations I've done internally and the tips I've picked up from <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">PresentationZen</a> and other similar web sites have really helped me improve my presenting skills.  Doing this thing in Singapore should be a lot easier as a result and I know I should be able keep the audience interested for the duration of the talk.  I'm fairly confident I've targeted the audience and made the presentation about them, not about me.<br /><br />I'll let you know how it went and pass on anything else I learned when I get back.
