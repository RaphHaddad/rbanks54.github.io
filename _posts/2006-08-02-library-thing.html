Yet another cool Web 2.0 tagging site. The <a href="http://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> is a site where you can enter your personal collection of books, tag them (as per <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>) and see who else reads similar items, find things they read, etc.<br /><br />Go there today and have a look.  P.S. On the left you'll see a little web widget of some of the books in <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/rbanks">my collection</a>.
