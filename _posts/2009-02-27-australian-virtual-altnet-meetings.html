<p>This Monday (March 2nd) we are having our first Australian Virtual Alt.Net meeting.</p> <p>The starting time is 9:30 PM eastern so that we can have the Perth people involved as well and make it an Australia wide thing, not just be an east coast thing.</p> <p>Details are on the <a href="http://ozalt.net">http://ozalt.net</a> site.&nbsp; I hope to see you there.</p> <p>P.S. If you can’t make it we’ll record it so you can catch up later.</p>
