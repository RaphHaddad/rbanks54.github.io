<p><a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog" target="_blank">J. LeRoy</a> (Jim Benson)&nbsp;has just written a fantastic post on <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2007/09/atomic-agility-.html" target="_blank">Atomic Agility</a>, i.e. the Social Atom and how people react to others actions, how group think evolves, and, quite interestingly, what this implies in terms of how we manage teams.&nbsp; It's a very thought provoking post and well worth a read.</p> <p>Here's a key takeout for me:</p> <blockquote> <p>The social atom highlights an important element of Agile Management - that individuals do behave differently in groups. We therefore manage both individuals <strong><em>and</em></strong> groups. Our tactics for individual performance, however, often rely on individual negotiating techniques and coercions, not on an analysis of the group dynamic.</p></blockquote> <p>It's quite a statement.&nbsp; There's a whole lot of lip service given in management circles to the team, but all to often it's the individuals we place first.&nbsp; Personally, the times where I've really seen greatest success is when I've ensured that the team comes first and the individuals second - when you can get each and every person in a team working for each other instead of themselves, then you will have found something truly rare and amazing, and the results will speak for themselves.</p>
