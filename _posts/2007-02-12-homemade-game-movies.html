This is kind of sad, but fairly amusing.  There's a <a href="http://ilkeryoldas.blogspot.com/2007/02/top-10-real-life-games.html">list of 10 short movies</a> based on famous video games, including classics like Double Dragon, Tekken, Grand Theft Auto &amp; Zelda.<br /><br />The Zelda one is really quite cool, especially when the "actor" does one of Links famous whirlwind sword moves (and when he's cutting bushes looking for rupees).<br /><br />Check it out at <a href="http://ilkeryoldas.blogspot.com/index.html">the thinking blog</a>.
