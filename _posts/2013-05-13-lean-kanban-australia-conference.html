A number of Australian agile community people, including my colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/stevegodbold" target="_blank">Steve Godbold</a>, have decided to run a conference for Lean and Kanban approaches.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this conference is that it is being funded and run using a crowd sourcing model and the organisers need to know if there's enough interest to run this thing.&nbsp; Of course, this means they need you to get behind it and pledge something towards it and sooner rather than later.<br /><br />What do you need to do? Two things:<br /><br />1. Go to <a href="http://www.pozible.com/lkanz">http://www.pozible.com/lkanz</a>&nbsp;and pledge something towards the conference<br />2. Spread the word.<br /><br />Simple!
