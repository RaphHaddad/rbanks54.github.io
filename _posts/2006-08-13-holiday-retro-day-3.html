Day 3. Sunday.<br /><br />It was Fathers day in Canada, which was a bit of a surprise since it's in September in Australia. A big day today.<br /><br />We got up reasonably early, jumped in the car and drove to Surrey where we went to church at <a href="http://www.familyvictory.com/">Victory Christian Centre</a>, where Jon and Helen Burns are from (we've seen them in Australia before). It was a great morning. The guys were very welcoming and it felt just like being among friends we haven't seen in a while.<br /><br />Afterwards we then drove down to Ladner and went to the <a href="http://www.reifelbirdsanctuary.com/">Reifel Bird Sanctuary</a>. Great name for a bird sanctuary! Anyway it was a beautiful place and a great way to spend a few hours. There weren't a great variety of birds around but we did see our first bald eagle in the wild, and a number of waterfowl.<br /><br /><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/195156134/"><img alt="P6180010" src="http://static.flickr.com/69/195156134_3f53f31772_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/195156067/"><img alt="P6180006" src="http://static.flickr.com/62/195156067_3370bca5f1_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/213726269/"><img alt="P6180029b" src="http://static.flickr.com/86/213726269_cf98412606_m.jpg" height="160" width="240" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/208959723/"><img alt="IMG_0224" src="http://static.flickr.com/77/208959723_d21ea473c3_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a><br /><br />We had a late lunch in Ladner and then drove up through Vancouver, across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions">Lions Gate Bridge</a> to the <a href="http://www.capbridge.com/">Capilano Suspension Bridge</a>. As it was later in the day, we avoided the tour busses and got to spend some leisurely time wandering through the treetop walk on the far side as well as being able to get some shots when no-one else was on the bridge.<br /><br /><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/213731941/"><img alt="P6180092a" src="http://static.flickr.com/77/213731941_3b27d1ee0c_m.jpg" height="240" width="180" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/213732053/"><img alt="P6180103a" src="http://static.flickr.com/90/213732053_d0ca1e0cde_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/213731725/"><img alt="P6180075a" src="http://static.flickr.com/86/213731725_d5fa0bb99f_m.jpg" height="240" width="180" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83433068@N00/213731833/"><img alt="P6180084a" src="http://static.flickr.com/28/213731833_5c93eaab45_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a><br /><br />All in all it was a great day and the bird sanctuary was excellent.
