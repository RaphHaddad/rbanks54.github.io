<p>I’m currently in London for the <a href="http://qconlondon.com/" target="_blank">QCon</a> developer conference.&nbsp; Over the last few days I’ve attended two half days of tutorials and Day 1 of the conference proper is just wrapping up now.&nbsp; It’s been a really enjoyable conference so far and everyone I’ve talked to has been really friendly, plus it’s been great to meet and chat to a few of the people in the industry I really respect (I’m resisting the urge to do some name dropping).&nbsp; It’s got quite a different feel to a Tech.Ed conferencce.&nbsp; Not better or worse, just different. Firstly the numbers are smaller so it feels more intimate, and there are people from the Java, Ruby and even Erlang communities here so there’s a much broader view of some of the topics, plus there are no IT Pro’s here – it’s all just developers.</p> <p>Anyway, when I came over I originally planned on blogging my thoughts after each session, but sometime during the keynote this morning while I was tweeting I decided that the twitter messages would be enough. If there was anything interesting I wanted to follow up on I could go back through the tweets, and the thought of each day going back to the hotel and trying to put some semi structured blog post together about the days sessions seemed somewhat redundant so I canned that idea and settled on live tweeting instead.&nbsp; Obviously tweets are going to be unfiltered and unstructured and a reflection of my thoughts at the time, but it’s much more immediate and I’m more likely to remember anything I need to that way.</p> <p>So, if you want to know what I’m up to you can <a href="http://twitter.com/rbanks54" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> or just use Twitter Search with the terms <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23qcon+rbanks54" target="_blank">#qcon and rbanks54</a>.</p>
