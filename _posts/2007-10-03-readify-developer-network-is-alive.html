Think of it as a bit like tech.ed, only spread out over 6 months and with no cost to attend and no time off work required (there's an early bird session @ 7:30 am and a night owl session @ 6:00 pm)<br /><br />I went to the first session yesterday morning in Sydney and really enjoyed it. <a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/">Paul Stovell</a> gave an overview of WPF and <a href="http://www.philipbeadle.net/">Philip Beadle</a> talked about Silverlight 1.1 and the interaction you can have with the DOM and Javascript. The Silverlight talk was particularly interesting for me as I hadn't really looked into this before.<br /><br />Across the morning and evening sessions yesterday there were over 60 people in attendance which was quite good considering that this was the first time we'd actually run the sessions.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RwLGZJ-HM5I/AAAAAAAAAKA/WIT_9i3jh2Y/s1600-h/IMAG0009.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5116870262121771922" style="FLOAT: left; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_5dD_rBQSs2o/RwLGZJ-HM5I/AAAAAAAAAKA/WIT_9i3jh2Y/s320/IMAG0009.jpg" border="0" /></a> If you live in Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra I'd really encourage you to have a look at the <a href="http://www.readify.net.au/rdncalendar.aspx">calendar</a> and see what sessions are of interest to you and then <a href="http://www.readify.net.au/rdnregister.aspx">register</a> to attend.<br /><br />P.S. I'm presenting the Workflow Primer on Nov 27 and also the Agile primer on Mar 11 in Sydney. I'll be presenting the Agile development full session in all 3 cities on Mar 25-27. I'd love to see you there.
