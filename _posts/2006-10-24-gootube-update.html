I <a href="http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-and-youtube-silliness.html">wrote</a> about <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">GooTube</span> (the term coined for the <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> & <a href="http://www.youtube.com"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">YouTube</span></a> merger) a little while back and how I didn't really "get it" from a corporate perspective.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.smh.com.au">Sydney Morning Herald</a> had an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/youtube-to-make-life-even-busier-for-google-lawyers/2006/10/23/1161455662458.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1">article</a> just recently about the same subject, but from a different perspective that I hadn't considered.  Basically they say that <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Google's</span> attitude is that it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  In other words, do it and let the lawyers sort it out.<br /><br />Apparently the market seems to agree with this attitude as Google shares <a href="http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?page=charting&mode=basics&amp;intraday=off&timeframe=1m&amp;charttype=ohlc&splits=off&amp;earnings=off&movingaverage=None&amp;lowerstudy=volume&comparison=off&amp;index=&drilldown=off&amp;symbol=GOOG&selected=GOOG">rose</a> over the last month (when rumours started surfacing) from about US$400 to around the US$480 mark (a 20% increase!).<br /><br />Kind of scary but I don't suppose there's any other way to push the boundaries is there?  Then again I don't see <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> doing the same thing (at least not as blatantly), or <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>, or <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>, or <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a>, or <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>, or <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo</a>, or <a href="http://www.sony.com">Sony</a>, or a bunch of others.  The only one I can think of who acts like that is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, and they seem to be improving their attitude and behaviour over time.<br /><br />Microsoft behaved/s the way they do because they're a monopoly.  A monopoly of the desktop and the office suite.  I sure hope Google isn't starting to behave the way they seem to be because they're a monopoly of <a href="http://www.google.com">search</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">internet</span> advertising</a>.<br /><br />Like all big companies there's plenty to like, but also plenty to improve on.  On the <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">GooTube</span> thing - for now I'll hold my judgement.
